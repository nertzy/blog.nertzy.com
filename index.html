		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ten years ago today, I pair programmed with Petra Jaros on the first commit for <a href="https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search" title="pg_search repository on GitHub">pg_search</a>, my Ruby gem.</p>

<p>Back then, I was working at <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs" title="Pivotal Labs, now part of VMware">Pivotal Labs</a> in New York on the <a href="https://www.casebook.net" title="Casebook PBC, formerly Case Commons">Casebook</a> project when we were having trouble with a search engine deployment. My client product manager trusted me to spend a month or so of full-time billable hours to put together a new solution to take advantage of the built-in search capabilities of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">PostgreSQL</a>. We open-sourced it, I wrote a <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/pg-search-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-postgresql-full-text-search" title="Blog post announcing pg_search">blog post</a> to announce its release, and before long we started to receive improvements from the community.</p>

<p>For the last ten years, I have maintained pg_search as a personal side project, for fun. I have learned quite a bit from maintaining the gem. Every once in a while, our test suite reveals a bug in Rails, which has been fun to investigate and try to fix. In my current job, I was recently able to use pg_search to build a type-ahead autocompleter.</p>

<p>Over the years I have released 62 versions of the gem. Most shocking of all, pg_search has been downloaded over 7.6 million times. I am humbled that the Ruby community has been so willing to use my work and contribute improvements over the years. I love free software, and it feels great to both give and receive.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the other software developers who have reported issues, submitted pull requests, and asked questions on our mailing list.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to the next decade! 🥂</p>

			 <p>I’ve just updated a couple of my old personal project websites.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://twittersucks.com/">Twitter Sucks!</a> - Upgraded all Ruby gems and got it working again. Updated CSS and picked newer fonts from Google Fonts.</li>
    <li><a href="http://flittr.nertzy.com/">Flittr</a> = Flickr + Twitter - Upgraded three major versions of Rails and got it (almost) working again. Switched from the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/fleakr">fleakr gem</a> to the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/flickr">flickr gem</a>. Right now, every tweet falls back to a <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?q=lolcats">lolcats image</a> because the Yahoo! Term Extraction API no longer exists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both applications are currently running on Heroku’s free tier. Once I get them modernized enough I may move them to the “Hobby” tier. I also upgraded both from their ancient Cedar-10 stack.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m catching up on MacStories&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/ipad-at-10/">&ldquo;iPad at 10&rdquo;</a> coverage from last month.</p>

<p>I keep coming across mentions of the original argument that the iPad is &ldquo;just a bigger iPhone&rdquo;. I always find that argument to be so strange, because the iPhone was a blockbuster category-defining device. I have never thought of the fact that an iPad is similar to a large iPhone as negative in any way. I also appreciate viewpoints like <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/for-ipad-accessibility-gives-its-just-a-big-iphone-new-meaning/">this one focused on accessibility</a> that make it obvious that being like a bigger iPhone is an incredible advantage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how aggressively people in the tech media will dismiss something just because it&rsquo;s not completely novel.</p>

<p>Anyway, 10 years later, I have finally gotten to the point where I don&rsquo;t own a laptop and use an iPad for all my mobile computing tasks.</p>

<p>Show me a case where a toll highway, tunnel, or bridge is converted to a free thoroughfare. It never happens.</p>

<p><blockquote>Incidentally, toll hikes were never contemplated in the original plan to build the Holland Tunnel, as tolls were to be rescinded after the initial costs of building the tunnel were recouped. But by the time this recoupment was close, PANYNJ had taken over the tunnel, and needed further financing for the construction of all the other Hudson River Crossings named after engineers (Goethels, Outerbridge) or presidents (Lincoln, Washington). PANYNJ is entirely non-profit, as it runs according to an interstate compact negotiated between New York and New Jersey. For PANYNJ to raise capital, it issues bonds, approved by the two states, which are backed by PANYNJ’s toll and rental income. Long story short, when PANYNJ needs financing, they raise tolls.</blockquote>

<p>My Sharp HDTV suffers from this greatly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s miserable waiting several seconds per channel while I try to hit &ldquo;channel up&rdquo; from a low number to a high number to catch a show that&rsquo;s about to start.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also completely horrible to turn on the TV to a very loud station and have to wait several seconds before I can turn the volume down.</p>

<p>The firmware is upgradable, so I hope that Sharp somehow magically hears my plea for an upgraded experience.</p>

			 <p>In the last couple years, I have started reading several books, but finished very few. It would seem that my appetite for new knowledge doesn&rsquo;t have a very long attention span.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I spend night after night reading as much as I can from my <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">feed reader</a>, which right this instant clocks in at 501 subscriptions, with 1295 unread articles. I have yet to discover anyone who is subscribed to more feeds than I am.</p>

<p>Now I know that sounds staggering, and it should, but I don&rsquo;t read everything. Indeed, it would be pretty much impossible to do so. But I do make quite an effort, and in doing so I have initiated the reading of countless streams of never-ending text. Yet more books I will never finish.</p>

<p>One thing I did recently finish, in one sitting, is <a href="http://www.goodthink.com/writing/view_stories.cfm?id=11&page_id=2">Patrick Combs&rsquo;s story from 1995</a> about cashing a junk mail check for over $95,000. Not sure how long it would be as a book but it would certainly take more physical pages than the 10 or so webpages that the story is split into.</p>

<p>The other day at work I printed out a page of Google API documentation that I was reading, and it came out to about 36 pages. I had already pretty much read the whole thing by the time I hit &ldquo;Print&rdquo;, so I was taken aback a little bit at just how much I must read in any given day without skipping a beat.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m even starting to read books on my iPhone. Right now I&rsquo;m reading Edwin A. Abbott&rsquo;s <em>Flatland</em> as part of the fun little <a href="http://classicsapp.com/">Classics</a> application. So there&rsquo;s yet another incomplete reading.</p>

<p>So I guess the point is that I read a lot. My hunger for knowledge cannot be satiated.</p>

<p>So how do you occupy your time? Video games? Some sort of physical activity? Let me know in the comments.</p>

			 <p>Start with a seasoned hamburger patty. The one I used was from Whole Foods and was covered with crumbs of onion, bell pepper, garlic, and parsley.</p>

<p>Cook on a grill. I used one of the tabletop ones that grills both sides at once. Well-done works best so that it&#8217;s a bit crumbly.</p>

<p>Make a bed of spinach on your plate.</p>

<p>Toss some sliced pepperoncini peppers over the spinach.</p>

<p>Lightly cover the spinach with a garlicky Italian dressing, then spread some flaxseed over it so that it sticks to the dressing here and there.</p>

<p>Take the burger patty and cut it into chunks, and spread over the salad.</p>

<p>Crumble some white cheddar on top, leaving the chunks fairly big.</p>

<p>Serve with some crackers. One great choice is &#8220;Everything Flatbread&#8221; by Passport which adds even more garlic and seeds to the mix.</p>

I figured I’d find it eventually, given that the last place I had seen it was in my apartment.</p>

<p>Last night I was doing laundry, when I heard clinking in the washer. Thinking it might be the ring, I dug around inside for awhile, realizing that I’d need to use a wrench to take off a bolt so I could remove the piece blocking the clinking object.</p>

<p>When I went over to where my tools were, I found my ring sitting right next to them.</p>

<p>The clinking object was a quarter.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in high school I discovered the music of <a href="http://virt.vgmix.com/">Virt</a>, a video game musician who back then was using <a href="http://www.lim.com.au/ImpulseTracker/">Impulse Tracker</a> to simulate the sound of the NES. Some of my favorites was his &#8220;Classical Favorites&#8221; tracks, available from his <a href="http://virt.vgmix.com/index.php?page=chip">chiptunes</a> page, albeit in tracker formats.</p>

<p>At the time, I was spending a lot of my own free time writing music with Impulse Tracker, so I dabbled a little bit in faking NES music, in my &#8220;LOFI&#8221; series, with some pleasing results. This was back around 2000 or so. I never quite got back into it, sadly.</p>

<p>Later on, I discovered <a href="http://8bitpeoples.com/">8bitpeoples</a>, a musical collective of chiptune artists. I went to their <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/destroy/">Data Destruction Tour</a> in Boston and got to talk to and admire the music of <a href="http://bit.shifter.net/">Bit Shifter</a>, <a href="http://www.nullsleep.com/">Nullsleep</a>, and <a href="http://www.covox.net">Covox</a>. I wrote a little bit about their music in a <a href="http://www.nullsleep.com/">post for alwaysBETA</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway it&#8217;s been a couple years since then, and I&#8217;ve been excited to find out that Nullsleep, Bit Shifter, and crew are performing a showcase and debuting a documentary at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> festivals here in Austin. Needless to say, I got pretty stoked.</p>

<p>This revived my long-standing desire to get one of the handful of different Game Boy cartridges that people have made for writing chiptunes. The one I&#8217;d wanted for a long time is named <a href="http://nanoloop.de">Nanoloop</a>, and I&#8217;m glad to say that I finally bit the builet and bought an original 1989 model Game Boy and the Nanoloop 1.3 cartridge!</p>

<p>For my first song, I took one of my old LOFI tracks and spent a short amount of time trying to mock it up on the actual Game Boy, to see how close I had come to simulating the real sound.</p>

<p>The results of this experiment are found in <a href="http://nertzy.com/media/lofi2.mp3">LOFI2</a>. Compare with the original <a href="http://nertzy.com/media/lofi2_original.mp3">LOFI2</a>, and please keep in mind that there are a lot more restrictions with using Nanoloop and a real Game Boy than I had in Impulse Tracker.</p>

<p>After a couple days, I put forth a little bit more effort and wrote my first completely new Game Boy track, <a href="http://nertzy.com/media/goof_step.mp3">Goof Step</a>. For this track, I kept things simple by only writing one pattern for each of the four available channels. I merely turn them on and off at strategic times to create the structure of the track. I&#8217;m pretty pleased with the results, and soon enough I will pursue a more ambitious and complete track.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

			 <p>A couple weeks ago I got the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/logicstudio/">Logic Studio</a>, Apple’s professional-level music writing software.</p>

<p>I upgraded from <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/oct/28logic7.html">Logic Express 7</a>, which was almost three years old when I bought it. The polish was definitely lacking, and I got many headaches using it.</p>

<p>Before that I used an even older OEM version of <a href="http://www.steinberg.net/969+M5a2dadd1fab.html">Cubase LE</a> that came with my <a href="http://www.presonus.com/firebox.html">PreSonus Firebox</a>. The Firebox is an excellent piece of equipment but the old Cubase software is even more atrocious in this day and age. I got some good work done in it but it took a lot of work.</p>

<p>So, long story short, I’ve been training myself with the 73-page Getting Started manual for the last few weeks. After that I might delve into parts of the bundled 1000-page manual for Logic Pro 8 and the 660-page manual for its bundled software instruments and effects!</p>

<p>Today I decided to try my hand at composing something real. I screwed around by layering a Bitcrusher distortion and a stereo Chorus on top of the “Hollow Pad” patch of the included ES E (Ensemble Synth) software instrument.</p>

<p>For drums I took one of the stock loops, Analog Drum Machine 52, and looped it under the stock Compressor with the “Toms Strong Compression” patch and under the SilverVerb reverb unit with the “Room” patch.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s a bit repetitive but it took only about an hour to throw together. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Recently Austin (the person) and I have been playing <a href="http://www18.big.or.jp/~hikoza/Prod/index_e.html">Warning Forever</a>, an innovative freeware video game for Windows that had a small wave of interest a few years ago.</p>

<p>Warning Forever is a “Shoot ‘Em Up”, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmup">shmup</a>, which means you basically fly a ship around the screen and shoot at enemies. What makes Warning Forever different is that there are only boss enemies, one at a time.</p>

<p>On top of that, after beating one enemy, the next enemy evolves defenses based on the strategies you use. So if you find it easy to attack the front of the enemy for a quick kill, the next enemy will have a beefed-up front section. Thus you are encouraged to start with strategies that you are not good at in order to build up the enemy’s more useless defenses.</p>

<p>All in all, this game evokes many of the qualities I find important in a game: replayability, challenge, and direct feedback. Perhaps most importantly, the game takes a simple concept and lets it shine without muddying it up with over-designed details.</p>

<p>Give it a shot sometime.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Campbell&#8217;s Soup.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simple, easy to make, and as American as apple pie. And more importantly, there are more varieties than I can even comprehend.</p>

<p>I like to grab a random soup that I&#8217;ve never tried before and take the plunge. </p>

<p>About a year ago I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Campbells-Pepper-Pot-Soup/dp/B0002BQLMS">Pepper Pot Soup</a>, which apparently is a popular soup style in Jamaica that was traditionally thought to have been invented during the American Revolution when Washington&#8217;s army was down to just beef tripe and peppercorns.</p>

<p>Sounds disgusting, eh? It wasn&#8217;t so bad, but it did take a bit of an open mind.</p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m trying out Golden Mushroom, which is a savory creamy beef stock soup with lots of mushroom pieces. I think I like this one a bit better.</p>

<p>Anyway, the can of soup is a staple of the bachelor life, and offers better nutrition and selection than something like ramen, so it gets my seal of approval.</p>

			 <p>In two months I will have been in Austin for a year, and so far I&#8217;ve had a blast. From <a href="http://www.aclfestival.com/">Austin City Limits Festival</a> and <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/">SxSW Interactive</a> to tons of local events in-between, I have more than satisfied my hunger for local flavor.</p>

<p>Speaking of flavor, I highly recommend several local food products.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quitepeculiar/292624780"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/113/292624780_2bb76e7fce.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="maine root"></a></p>

<p>My favorite would have to be <a href="http://www.maineroot.com/products_sarsaparilla.php">Maine Root sarsaparilla soda</a>, which despite its name and its roots in Maine (pun intended), has an Austin branch after one of its founders moved here. Their pungent and powerful <a href="http://www.maineroot.com/products_gingerbrew.php">ginger brew</a> is also great.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rocketlass/153046630"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/63/153046630_2c41bd9250.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Jeremy &amp; El Milagro"></a></p>

<p>I also suggest <a href="http://www.el-milagro.com">El Milagro tortilla chips</a>, made just east of I-35 on Sixth Street. To date they are the only chips that could possibly compare to the fresh chips at Oklahoma City&#8217;s <a href="http://oklahomacity.citysearch.com/profile/8299722/oklahoma_city_ok/ted_s_cafe_escondido.html">Ted's Café Escondido</a>, which despite a year in Austin is still my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant. I will need to conduct further research here in town.</p>

<p>Whenever I&#8217;m downtown breakdancing at a club I often satiate myself with the best street food in Austin, the <a href="http://www.chooseaustinfirst.com/member/66/The_Best_Wurst.html" title="Choose Austin First Member - The Best Wurst">Best Wurst</a>. I like it with everything: onions, sauerkraut, mustard, and their very own special curry ketchup.</p>

			 <p>While most of you were watching Super Bowl XLI, I went to my first breakdancing class. I&rsquo;m signed up to weekly classes at <a href="http://www.inthedancezone.com/">Dance Zone</a> through the UT Texas Union <a href="http://informalclasses.org/">Informal Classes</a> program.</p>

<p>The first class started with a brief discussion of the art and a passionate plea by our instructor to understand the history of what it&rsquo;s all about, which was refreshing since I worried it might turn out to be some lame hip hop dancing sort of class.</p>

<p>Nope, this is the real deal. My instructor has trained with the original B-Boys such as the ones featured in the classic movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0086998/">Breakin&rsquo;</a>.</p>

<p>There are about 10 beginners and 6 or 7 more advanced B-Boys and B-Girls in my class. The pace is pretty fast, which I appreciate.</p>

<p>On day one we started with a few basic moves to help us catch the beat, as classic original funk and breakbeat songs blasted on the hi-fi. The instructor then had us try to walk on our hands across the floor. I could do about 3 or 4 steps the few times I didn&rsquo;t immediately fall over.</p>

<p>After that we learned perhaps the most fundamental move of all, and the basis of &ldquo;footwork&rdquo;, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-step">6-step</a>. Here&rsquo;s a pretty good YouTube video to show what I mean.</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8egcCAIwj0Q" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>

<p>I am still a bit sore from it, two days later, but that is subsiding now. I can&rsquo;t wait to get back in there!</p>

			 <p>So after all that brouhaha I still managed to make it out unscathed, save for a couple hundred dollars in cash.</p>

<p>And one full day of bureaucracy later and I had already acquired my temporary driver license, my registration, my license tag, and my car inspection sticker, not to mention a brand-new 6-month car insurance plan.</p>

<p>And IKEA also failed to tell me that I was missing the midbeam for my bed, or the frame for my desk. I had my brothers stop at the Dallas IKEA to pick them up for me, only to find later that the table/desk top that they sold me was smaller than what I asked for. But I don&#8217;t have my receipt; it was in my lost wallet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.archive.org/download/ikea_2/ikea.mov"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/30/90696288_c97eb299eb_m.jpg" alt="IKEA sucks"></a></p>

<p>Austin, the person, has come down to Austin, the city, to visit. He&#8217;s looking for a good job down here. Finally he can live in himself. For now he lives on an inflatable mattress in my living room.</p>

<p>Other than that I&#8217;ve been working hard, since the next rev of Spiceworks is due out soon. This will be the first release with some of my code in it. I&#8217;m pretty excited about the feature I implemented. I think the users will notice it pretty quick. Can&#8217;t wait to hear the feedback.</p>

<p>But after my last post, where&#8217;s the adventure, you ask? Well today I was typing on my keyboard (as I often do at my job) and what looked to be a small roach ran around from behind my MacBook Pro and jumped on my arm. I also jumped. Looking closer, I saw that it was actually a very tiny gecko!</p>

<p>And if you&#8217;re wondering if this Gecko first sounded like Kelsey Grammar, then an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation">RP</a> Brit, then either a Cockney or an Australian (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1006060205935">oh, the controversy</a>), then you&#8217;d be disappointed. You see, he was much too small to make barely a peep. That didn&#8217;t stop him from running up and down the wall and behind my desk, however. And I got another brand of car insurance anyway.</p>

<p>If only I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seta">setae</a>&#8230;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Sunday I drove to Houston to shop for furniture at <a href="http://www.ikea.com">IKEA</a>, since my apartment only has an inflatable mattress right now. The plan was to drive the three hours, look through all the furniture I could, and get as much of what I need as possible.</p>

<p>Now several of my friends have told me about IKEA, so I knew I was headed toward something a bit different.</p>

<p>The drive to Houston was relatively uneventful. I listened to <a href="http://www.hibob.fm">Bob FM</a>, singing along to Deep Blue Something&#8217;s &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s&#8221; and the song that reminds us, and Bill and Ted, that we are just &#8220;dust in the wind&#8221;.</p>

<p>I arrived and was instantly taken by the amusement-park-like parking lot. There were families all around loading up new furniture for the kids, young couples filling out their new shared homes, and a mish-mash of foreign languages.</p>

<p>I walked inside hungry, so I immediately headed for the Café next to the Exit. The customer experience at IKEA is very well-defined beforehand, so it felt quite unnatural to go straight to the Exit Café. I wanted to get Swedish meatballs, as advertised, but couldn&#8217;t find them. I settled for two hot dogs and a Swedish pear soda.</p>

<p>Unfazed, I set on my journey through the store. I brought in my laptop in hopes of finding a free wireless internet connection inside. I take whatever I can these days.</p>

<p>But alas I found none, and realized I would get tired spending five hours lugging my new corporate behemoth 17&#8221; Macbook Pro on my back. So I quickly dashed through the preset IKEA path and out the exit, hoping no one would think I was trying to steal the tiny clipboard in my backpack that could have easily been found in the home organization section downstairs.</p>

<p>Have once again ruined the pre-planned shopping experience, I set out to find a couch. A few hours later I was still weighing my options and had to move on for fear of running out of time.</p>

<p>Perpetually clutching my little IKEA note card was my left hand, whose thumb began pulsating with a painful tightness. I dropped my things into my shopping bag and kept on, trying to help my hand relax.</p>

<p>I eventually decided on a nice dark brown table and a matching bed with foam mattress. When I picked up the pieces I found they were out of dark brown bed frames so I snagged a medium brown last minute. I popped into the checkout line and grabbed a last-minute spot purchase five dollar welcome mat. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Or rather, mission accepted, because little did I know what was still in store for me upon my fateful return.</p>

<p>I spent half an hour trying to get twine properly tied around the furniture pieces on top of my car. My Boy Scout skills only got me so far and I asked for help, after most of the families and more frantic customers had been helped. The IKEA employee started to really wrap it up well as he noticed I had tied my car doors shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;You going to climb in through the window?&#8221; he half-jokingly suggested, and I made sure it was possible and said, &#8220;Sure, why not?&#8221; He proceeded to secure my goods firmly atop my Chevrolet Impala, and I stuffed myself into my car.</p>

<p>As I often do, I checked for all of my belongings before I left. That&#8217;s when I realized I couldn&#8217;t find my wallet. Now, I had just used it to buy the very furniture that was blocking me from fully searching the interior of my car. I had already found all of the various pocket gizmos that I had haphazardly dumped onto my car floorboard. But still no wallet.</p>

<p>Unfazed, I went back into the store and asked if anyone had found it. Alas, no one had. They promised to give me a call if it shows up, and try to arrange to ship it to Austin when and if it does.</p>

<p>So, without any way to pay for things, I set off back to Austin. Right then I realized I didn&#8217;t have enough gas to go the whole way. Surely it will show up. Alternatively, I can wing something, I decided, and I was on my way.</p>

<p>About an hour later, as I listened to two nerds on a radio show incessantly discuss computer games and the 25th anniversary of the IBM PC, a large bright streak shot through the sky in front of me. In a second, the light appeared, shot down at about a 30-degree angle with the ground, and exploded into many small bright bits, fading into nothingness.</p>

<p>I halfway braced for an explosion, unsure if I had seen a meteor or a missile. Either way, if anything was left at impact it could have made quite a large blast. But instead, I only found silence. I immediately called my parents, who confirmed I had witnessed one of the <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/07aug_perseids.htm">Perseids</a>. Here I was during the prime time of the meteor shower, driving late at night along desolate Texas countryside. The timing was just too perfect.</p>

<p>Now that I was alert, I kept on trucking. I spent a great deal of time trying to find a good station to listen to <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Matt Drudge</a>&#8217;s radio show. I constantly had to switch between five stations that I could barely pick up, all of which carried Drudge&#8217;s droning voice and characteristic long silences.</p>

<p>As I neared the small town of Elgin, my fuel light came on. I needed to get some gas if I was going to make it the final 50 miles. I realized I had a stash of coins for use on toll roads, so I looked for a 24-hour gas station. Instead all I found were closed, dark convenience stores and their well-lit but credit-card-only gas pumps. No good without my wallet, which as yet hadn&#8217;t showed up.</p>

<p>I pulled into an empty <a href="http://www.heb.com">H.E.B. supermarket</a> parking lot and sized up my situation. A nice man wearing a U.S. Postal Service shirt pulled in to fill up his car, and I reluctantly asked him to help me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you give me five dollars of gas?&#8221; I asked, explaining my situation. I played to his sympathies by adding that I was newly out of college and couldn&#8217;t even get in the doors of my car.</p>

<p>I explained to him very nicely that if he put his credit card in the pump, he could pump about five dollars in himself, and I would be willing to pay him in change or mail him a check. He wasn&#8217;t biting, and rightfully so, considering the absurdity and my lack of ability to faithfully prove my car wasn&#8217;t stolen.</p>

<p>He found this situation puzzling and tried his best to help. However, the best advice he could come up in his confusion was for me to take the pieces off of the top of my car and load them inside, which I think would be impossible and also not helpful.</p>

<p>He pointed me down the road to the still-open Chevron station. It was now about a half hour past midnight.</p>

<p>I waited until no one was looking, pulled up to the Chevron gas pump, then climbed out my window. Inside, I told the lady working there my entire situation and then handed her two Susan B. Anthony dollars, five quarters, five nickels, and four dimes, for a grand total of $3.90.</p>

<p>Back outside (it was prepay) I filled up my car, as the worker lady stepped out for a smoke. I was pumping gas and this lady is <em>smoking</em>? Luckily my just over a gallon of gas did not take long and I got out of there. I predicted to myself that the fuel light would come on again as I pulled into my apartment complex.</p>

<p>I got into Austin, ever eyeing my gas meter as it dwindled but held on. I was making good distance, and would make it!</p>

<p>I got onto US Highway 183, and took the access road under Interstate 35. The construction was everywhere, and the plethora of completed and incomplete highway ramps made for an interesting scene. A few police cars had their lights on to signal the construction, as I had seen a few days earlier in the same spot after a wrong turn.</p>

<p>But the Police were otherwise busy, I discovered. As the light finally turned green and I drove past, I watched as an officer guided a handcuffed man into the back seat of his cruiser. The timing of my drive by framed the shot just as any television drama might have.</p>

<p>Still trapped in my car, hoping the doors were securely shut, and still unable to shut the windows enough to mute the loud highway noise, I pressed on. Finally I pulled into my apartment complex and watched as, surely enough, my fuel light turned on.</p>

<p>I unloaded my car, refreshed that I could finally use its doors. But still, I found no wallet.</p>

<p>I left my small cart that I used for the heavy pieces out on the apartment drive. As I was composing myself inside I heard a rattling outside and realized that someone was taking it. I ran outside, only to find my cart sitting in the hallway outside my neighbor&#8217;s door. No one was to be found.</p>

<p>So I quickly nabbed the cart and brought it inside. I heard some people run down the stairs outside and decided to pop back out to explain the case of the mysterious disappearing cart, but once again they were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>So I went inside to cancel my credit cards.</p>

<p>Luckily I had already lost my debit card last Thursday by leaving it in the drive-up ATM, so its replacement is on the way. Until then I will probably have to rely on writing checks and hoping people will take my expired passport as valid ID.</p>

<p>I still need to get my Texas driver license, car title, inspection, and license plate. For new residents, there is a specific process one must follow, as everything depends on something else.</p>

<p>But without my Oklahoma driver license, I probably cannot get my car inspected, and an un-inspected car cannot get its title paid, and an untitled car cannot be used to get a new Texas license, even ignoring the fact that my lack of my Oklahoma license will probably force me to take another driving test anyway. And last but not least, I won&#8217;t be able to get a Texas license plate to replace my Oklahoma plate, which expired at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>And on top of all this I&#8217;m switching over my auto insurance, which is why I waited to get my inspection in the first place.</p>

<p>I better not get pulled over, because I won&#8217;t have identification, a valid license plate, a license, or even an inspection sticker. Cross your fingers for me.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not really even a concern because I only have checks as a method of spending money, and I doubt I can get to a gas station that wouldn&#8217;t ask to see ID using only the sixteenth of a tank I have left. Needless to say, I hope my new ATM card comes in the mail by tomorrow morning. Not that I would know where to go anyway because I still have no internet access.</p>

<p>But at least I still have my health!</p>

<p>As long as you ignore the carpal tunnel attack.</p>

<p>P.S. This post may sound negative but really I am enjoying the absurdity of it all. I&#8217;m doing fine and should be able to get through all of this with only the required amount of elbow grease.</p>

			 <p>I have been hired on as a UI Designer at <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com">Spiceworks</a>, a startup company in Austin, Texas. This Thursday I’ll be driving down to start my apartment search, and I start work this Monday.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" title="spiceworks" src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a9fc04c87.jpg" alt="Spiceworks logo" width="281" height="30" /></p>

<p>It should be a pretty good gig. They have just released the public beta version of their <a href="http://spiceworks.com/signup/">free IT management application</a> for small (~25 computer) networks. It’s all done in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>, but interestingly enough it runs on your local machine. This should open up some interesting UI possibilities given that client/server latency issues are greatly reduced.</p>

<p>I met several of my coworkers during interviews and I am looking forward to working with them and becoming their friend. Several of them are involved in local Rails groups and most if not all of them have been through multiple successful startups.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will be driving down on Thursday, and then aggressively searching for apartments over the weekend. If everything goes well I will be moved in by Sunday. Otherwise I will have to wing it somehow.</p>

<p>Before I head out I’m going up to my hometown of Enid, Oklahoma, to see my grandparents.</p>

<p>I don’t know anyone in the Austin area, so if you’re there and I didn’t realize it please drop me a line.

			 <p>Today as I was going to get some dinner, about six <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CH-47_Chinook">Chinook helicopters</a> flew overhead. They were headed roughly northeast. It was quite a sight, and they were pretty low to the ground.</p>

<p>I had to check the radio and make sure it wasn&#8217;t yet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III">World War III</a>. It wasn&#8217;t.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just realized that in the course of a normal day I no longer have to deal with cathode ray tubes (CRTs).</p>

<p>Over the weekend while relaxing in <a href="http://www.bransongrandplaza.com/">my hotel</a> at my family reunion in Branson, Missouri, I found the worst CRT television set I had heard in quite a while. Every time I would change the channel, the set would emit a piercing high-pitched noise that my parents could not hear. My brothers and I felt tortured by it, especially my youngest brother Jon.</p>

<p>At Olin, Prof. Gill Pratt taught me that the high pitches associated with CRTs are horribly annoying to young people but are impossible to hear in old age due to a lifetime of overexposure. But I think that may change in the near future.</p>

<p>CRTs are not a wonderful technology. They have created a worldwide chemical disposal problem and they eat up energy in a wasteful large form factor made of shatter-vulnerable glass. But finally they have started to get replaced by better technologies like plasma, LCD, and organic LED (OLED) displays.</p>

<p>Every day, the only displays I usually interact with my Apple monitor, Dell laptop, and my parents&#8217; new little HDTV, all of which are LCDs. Thus, I haven&#8217;t heard that infernal high-pitched whine in some time. Now I find that I have fewer headaches and often feel more relaxed.</p>

<p>So my challenge to you is to find a CRT monitor in your life and consider transitioning it to a better technology. You just might make your life a little more pleasant.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>About a mile from my house one finds the Kilpatrick Turnpike. You might wonder who this toll road was named after. A successful inventor? An Olympic athlete? A war hero?</p>

<p>At first I couldn&#8217;t find an answer, as the <a href="http://www.pikepass.com">Oklahoma Turnpike Authority</a> doesn&#8217;t give any information on whom Oklahoma&#8217;s eight turnpikes are named after.</p>

<p>What I did find there was that the turnpikes won&#8217;t be paid off until 2028. Better get used to paying those tolls! Also, the public&#8217;s debt is spread across all of the roads, so tolls won&#8217;t end on any of these roads until all eight are paid off. But then the poor turnpike officials would lose their jobs! We can&#8217;t have that! Oh well, all they have to do is construct yet another expensive highway to ensure that the tolls keep flowing.</p>

<p>After that little realization I finally found the answer to my original question within <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/aaa276673cabc870?hl=en&amp;">this 2002 USENET post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Kilpatrick Turnpike - named for OKC oilman and philathropist[sic] John Kilpatrick. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds pretty good, right? Until you realize that Kilpatrick was the director of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority around the time that the road was proposed. He named it after himself! Oh boy!</p>

<p>Reading more into that post, I discovered that Turner Turnpike was named for former Oklahoma governor Roy J. Turner, whose claim to fame was establishing the turnpike system itself. And another major turnpike is named for H. E. Bailey, who among other things was, of course, a member of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority.</p>

<p>I wish that when the roads are set up to perpetually take tolls from the people, that their names would at least recognize someone who might inspire the populace to do things other than set up more regulations, taxes, and tolls.</p>

			 <p>Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about getting into open source development. Right now, I&#8217;m thinking about diving into a project that I like a lot. You&#8217;re using it right now, if you didn&#8217;t know! It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a> blog engine which is based on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a>. I&#8217;ve been running this blog, for better or for worse, on Typo for some time now.</p>

<p>Typo has been coming into its own recently but still needs some good help. I&#8217;ve been studying Rails along with Ruby in general and I think it&#8217;s time I get my feet wet. I&#8217;ve been listening in on the <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/wiki/MailingList">mailing list</a> and might submit a patch to the <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/">Trac site</a> sometime soon.</p>

<p>Have any of you done open source development? Do you have any tips or things I should read before I get going?</p>

			 <p>Lately people have asked me frequently what I want to be doing once I graduate. I&#8217;ve finally found a quick answer that I believe encompasses all of the different areas in which I&#8217;m interested.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to go into interaction/interface design, web application development, user-centered product design, or some similar area.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also be happy doing some sort of audio-oriented digital signal processing, audio synthesis, or audio electronics sort of field as a backup.</p>

<p>On top of all this I hope to become politically active somehow at the local level, wherever I end up. Possibly I could even work for a think-tank that deals with technological issues.</p>

<p>These fields are fairly disparate, and I don&#8217;t have a good sense of which one or ones I will end up in. But they do all hold a common thread.</p>

<p>So when people ask me, now I answer, &#8220;I want to ensure that my work treats people as humans, rather than mindless drones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any engineering work that I do ought to make technology more accessible and natural to use for real people. Any audio work I do should focus on making things sound natural and pleasant to real people. Any political work I do should help bridge the gap between arcane policy, political wrangling, and the real people who are affected.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my new answer. It&#8217;s not too focused, but then again, it finally makes my plans cohesive in some manner.</p>

<p>By the way, sorry I&#8217;ve been gone for a while. My blog software should work properly now. I had to revert to the default theme. Hopefully the problems will get fixed soon because I liked how it was before.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry to bore you with all of that technical mumbo-jumbo. Here is the comment I posted:</p>

<blockquote>
I think that the competitive success of a good phone UI would be a watershed moment for interaction design. I feel like the general public would finally understand the idea that having lots of features is not what they want. Iâ€™m still shocked that none of the phone companies has stepped up and been bold enough to do it.
</blockquote>

<p>I really do think this is true. All of the cell phone companies are running around with their heads cut off not giving anyone what they really need.</p>

			 <p>I spent a few hours today walking up and down Venice Beach and reminiscing on life. I&#8217;ve always preferred heat to cold and so I appreciated being out of the Boston weather. I doubt I will ever choose to live so far north again after I graduate.</p>

<p>All of my friends out here are hired for jobs that last a few weeks, a month, or just a couple of days. My mom has also recently picked up this style of employment. Being raised by a salaried father, I realize I haven&#8217;t been exposed to the contract worker lifestyle, which is a lot different. Each week brings something new and the days off might be the weekend one week and weekdays the next. Not sure if I would prefer the randomness of this style or the regularity of a salaried Monday-Friday job.</p>

<p>Either way, it&#8217;s looking like I&#8217;m headed toward the entrepreneur lifestyle, which seems to be some weird mix of the two. Each day during the day I ought to be expected to contribute some real value to the company, anywhere from product design to keeping on top of everything else that&#8217;s going on. But when something big hits outside of the normal hours, there&#8217;s still work that needs to be done, sometimes on really short notice.</p>

<p>In a way, it&#8217;s a lot more work, but I love the diverse challenges, the freedom, and the do-it-yourself attitude, so I should be fine.</p>

			 <p>Lately I&#8217;ve been checking out a lot of books from the library. I used to be quite a book person when I was young, especially in elementary school. Most of my fondest memories from when I lived in <a href="http://www.enid.org/">Enid, Oklahoma</a>, and went to Hoover Elementary School involve me in the library reading a book on language or music or computers or something else that I&#8217;m still interested in today.</p>

<p>At the time I had no idea that I was probably seeding ideas and thoughts that would recur throughout my entire education. The ideas that have come most readily to me over the years often involve pieces of my experiences from a few key times in my life in which I immersed myself in some sort of media, such as all of the digital stuff my friends and I toyed around with in high school.</p>

<p>Reading all of these books lately has gotten me thinking about how I want to keep up after I leave Olin. With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> to whet my tastebuds, I have found countless subjects that I want to learn more about, but each thing I find leads to three more. I&#8217;m a bit overwhelmed with the sheer amount of stuff I want to know about.</p>

<p>I think once I graduate this May I will initially fill most of my newfound free time with books and music and perhaps some documentaries. Fiction doesn&#8217;t interest me much, so I will probably spend only just a little time with my Thomas Pynchon books.</p>

<p>If I had all of the money in the world, I would buy music all day long. Of all of the songs I&#8217;ve heard, there are far too many by artists whose other music I have never heard.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can really portray how I feel about all of this stuff out there. I know that on her radio show Dr. Laura always says she doesn&#8217;t know how people can ever get bored with so many books in the world. I think that people get bored when they lack social stimulation, and books don&#8217;t really solve that. But I&#8217;m pretty happy with my social situation, so I feel I can heed her advice and dive in.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this certain depth at which I used to immerse myself into books that just cannot be duplicated on the Internet and in flashy video games, movies, and television shows. I think what has happened is that I&#8217;ve rediscovered it.</p>

			 <p>I ushered for a play at Brandeis the other night. It was a comedy entitled <em>The Suicide</em>, being put on for Russian Week. Thanks to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/p_OLIN_a">Polina</a> for suggesting it. I really enjoyed making sure that everything went smoothly for the audience. It reminded me of the days when I was a roadie for my friends&#8217; band.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/theater/season.html">Brandeis theater schedule</a>:</p>

<blockquote> An unemployed man contemplates suicide but is besieged by spokespeople of discontented groups, from butchers to intellectuals, who want to turn his suicide into a gesture on their behalf. This brilliant Soviet-era satire is a classic of the Russian theater. </blockquote>

<p>Anyway we caught the final showing and it was pretty crazy. About halfway through so many things were going on at once and it was hard to figure out what the point of it all was. Experimental theater at its finest, I guess. Since it was the last performance, I think they added some crazy stuff like having a random lady walk out of this guy&#8217;s closet and lifting up the backdrop to reveal the backstage area.</p>

<p>I talked with one of the other ushers, a graduate student who sat this play out for lack of enough parts to play. She explained the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method">Suzuki Method</a> to me (although I feel like I might have gotten the name wrong after reading that Wikipedia entry). She&#8217;s going to be in Euripides&#8217;s <em>Bacchae</em> later this semester. I might go usher that as well to enrich the 1/4 of myself that is Greek. It&#8217;d be a good way to get out of Olin a little more.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hello everyone.</p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Swimming in the Earth</em>, my new blog. I will be posting anything and everything here. My other websites are linked at <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/">Grant Page Central</a>.</p>

<p>I bet you&#8217;re wondering how I chose the name <em>Swimming in the Earth</em>.</p> <p>A couple weeks ago, I was in class here at <a href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin College</a>. The class was SCOPE, our team-based yearlong engineering capstone project, and we had a guest speaker talking about ethics.</p>

<p>To make a point about what words people associate with good ethics, the speaker asked, &#8220;When you die, what epitath would you want written on your gravestone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without skipping a beat, I thought to myself, &#8220;He swam in the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was really taken aback by this random thought. I knew exactly what it meant to me, but as an image I&#8217;m not sure it fully conveys its point. Indeed, it invites the joke that my dead body would be &#8220;swimming&#8221; in the earth of the grave.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve gone off-topic.</p>

<p>Swimming in the earth is my way of explaining the concept of living life to its fullest. This planet has a lot to offer me in the short time I have here. If I don&#8217;t break some rules and get my feet wet I&#8217;ll have missed out on a lot of experiences.</p>

<p>Thus, I should go swimming in the earth. Right through the dirt. Through the sky. Through the water too, but that&#8217;s too easy. I should run around and sit still. Get comfortable and catch myself off guard.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll be writing all about it here. Technology, humor, politics, language, music, society. Anything is fair game. Please leave this blog better than you found it; comments graciously welcomed.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.nertzy.com/2006/02/07/why-i-think.html">Why I think Verizon won&#39;t win the bandwidth battle with Google</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.nertzy.com/2006/02/07/why-i-think.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-02-07 17:48:00 -0500">Feb 7, 2006</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/06/AR2006020601624.html">Verizon is threatening</a> to start charging Google for the traffic it generates over its internet backbone.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;The network builders are spending a fortune constructing and maintaining the networks that Google intends to ride on with nothing but cheap servers&#8221; [Verizon senior vice president and deputy general counsel John] Thorne told a conference marking the 10th anniversary of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. &#8220;It is enjoying a free lunch that should, by any rational account, be the lunch of the facilities providers.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>Strange broken lunch metaphors aside, it seems Verizon wants Google to start paying for the traffic that goes on their lines between users and Google&#8217;s services. Never mind that the bandwidth already gets paid for by the end users.</p>

<p>The threat? Verizon will add a bottleneck to the connection, slowing down Google while letting other sites through at full speed. One might also notice that Verizon and Yahoo! <a href="http://news.com.com/Yahoo,+Verizon+launch+co-branded+DSL/2100-1034_3-5841915.html">launched a co-branded DSL service</a> last August. Coincidence?</p> <p>Anyway, let&#8217;s go through a little thought experiment, shall we?</p>

<ol>
<li>Google refuses to pay Verizon for its bandwidth.</li>
<li>Verizon starts capping bandwidth for Google traffic.</li>
<li>Verizon customers notice that Google is slower, and that Google is snappy on their friend&#8217;s cable modem.</li>
<li>Cable modem commericals tout great performance on &#8220;the sites most used on the Internet, such as Google.&#8221;</li>
<li>Over time, Verizon loses customers because the most well-known and most-used site doesn&#8217;t perform well.</li>
<li>Verizon eats their words and lifts the cap.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, Google doesn&#8217;t pay anything extra, most users don&#8217;t care that anything happened but are subtly repelled by Verizon, and Verizon wastes money on implementing and maintaining a lot of routers that now have to filter everything and hold onto packets for longer.</p>

<p>I for one am not worried about anything coming of this.</p>

Jimmy Massey has been telling anybody who will listen about the atrocities that he and other Marines committed in Iraq.</blockquote><br /><br />OK, we&rsquo;ve heard these things before.  But here&rsquo;s the kicker:<br /><br /><blockquote>Each of his claims is either demonstrably false or exaggerated - according to his fellow Marines, Massey&rsquo;s own admissions, and the five journalists who were embedded with Massey&rsquo;s unit, including a reporter and photographer from the Post-Dispatch and reporters from The Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal.</blockquote><br /><br />A good look into what&rsquo;s wrong with the mainstream media&rsquo;s coverage of the Iraq war.  I don&rsquo;t care which side you&rsquo;re on, this is just complete craziness.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1859664,00.html">London Times article</a> has the headline &ldquo;Iraq battle stress worse than WWII&rdquo;.<br /><br />However, a quick reading of the article shows that at most the article claims that &ldquo;troops in Iraq are suffering levels of battle stress not experienced since the second world war&hellip;&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t really justify the use of &ldquo;worse&rdquo;.<br /><br />A better headline might have read &ldquo;Iraq battle stress similar to WWII&rdquo; or &ldquo;Iraq battle stress at WWII levels&rdquo;, even though even then there is no actual metric by which to compare the stress.<br /><br />On a sidenote, I agree with the sentiments of this article, and have a newfound understanding as to why the United States consistently refuses to allow its citizens and soldiers to be answerable to the International Court of Justice.  It&rsquo;s one thing for your own country to try you under its laws after you serve it in war.  It&rsquo;s yet another to have to face an international body to which you have virtually no say.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.nertzy.com/2005/07/10/blogs-try-to.html">Blogs try to malign Brit Hume&#39;s reaction to the 7/7 London attacks</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.nertzy.com/2005/07/10/blogs-try-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2005-07-10 22:53:00 -0500">Jul 10, 2005</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over at mediamatters.org there is <a href="http://mediamatters.org/static/video/dayside-200507070007.mov">a video clip of Brit Hume reporting on Fox News</a> and an <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200507070007">accompanying post</a> <s>accusing him of being callous</s> implying that he was callous [it is not explicitly stated, <em>Ed.</em>] in response to the 7/7 London bombings.  I found this in <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/node/3833">a post from the Center for Media and Democracy</a>.<br /><br />The quote from Brit Hume is<br /><br /><blockquote>&ldquo;my first thought when I heard &mdash; just on a personal basis &mdash; when I heard there had been this attack and I saw the futures this morning, which were really in the tank, I thought, &lsquo;Hmmm, time to buy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</blockquote><br /><br />The problem with the ensuing criticism of Hume is that the bloggers imply that Hume means that immediately upon hearing about the attacks, he thought about buying futures for his own personal financial gain.  However, upon further inspection, Hume probably means to say that he knew about the bombings, and then immediately after seeing futures prices thought about purchasing them.<br /><br />Either way, Hume&rsquo;s comment shows that he believes that the British economy will remain strong in the face of these attacks.  I find it hard to criticize him for his clearly personal remarks (which he denoted as such) given as a sidenote in response to a question about the attacks&rsquo; impact on the British economy.<br /><br />On my own sidenote, I realize that this blog is pretty stagnant.  I think I will evolve it into more of a free-form political and worldly discussion so that I don&rsquo;t trap myself into only being able to post about logical fallacies.  Sure, there are plenty of fallacies, but I don&rsquo;t really have the time and ability to properly research and find them in the swaths of media I read every day.</p>

			 <p>Today I happened upon the Paseo Arts Festival.<br>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy/16165424/" title="Paseo Arts festival, 2005-05-28"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/10/16165424_ac66c23dfd_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Paseo Arts festival, 2005-05-28"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><br>
That picture doesn&rsquo;t really do it justice.&nbsp; Anyway, I sneaked
around as it was closing and as the band played &ldquo;Inagaddadavida&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The Paseo is a small street off the beaten path in Oklahoma City where
a ton of artists live and have studios.&nbsp; I saw a scultpor&rsquo;s
studio, photographer&rsquo;s studios, and a lot of closed Indian Taco stands.<br>
<br>
Lately I haven&rsquo;t been up to too much.&nbsp; The friends and I have
resolved to watch all of the Star Wars movies in order.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
the hugest fan but it&rsquo;s a good source of trivia for who knows
when.&nbsp; (Jeopardy!, here I come)<br>
<br>
I hope that <a href="http://grantstake.blogspot.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">my other blog</a>
doesn&rsquo;t wither and die.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that I will
have enough sources of logical fallacies in news articles to make it
interesting.&nbsp; I will keep looking though.&nbsp; Feel free to
contact me if you find some.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to stick to reputable
sources.<br>
<br>
My new phone has better text messaging and photo mail abilities, so
I&rsquo;ve been sending dog pictures out to Carrie and posting cameraphones
pictures on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nertzy/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Flickr site</a>.&nbsp; They are decidedly low quality but fun nonetheless.&nbsp; One of these days I&rsquo;ll get my actual camera fixed.<br>
<br>
Meredith&rsquo;s father brews beer (and wine, actually) at home.&nbsp; He
keeps track of every batch in a notebook.&nbsp; Right now he&rsquo;s working
on his 57th batch.&nbsp; Seeing all of the handwriting made me wish I
had something to keep track of longterm like that.<br>
<br>
For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, I am obsessed with typography these days.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t just a passing thing, like my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684831309/102-7414142-8344960" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptography</a> phase or my oscillating interest with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684831309/102-7414142-8344960" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Pynchon</a>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m downright obsessed.&nbsp; My two favorite fonts of the moment are <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000074" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incognito</a> and <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000057" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolly</a>, both available from <a href="http://www.veer.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veer</a>, the design company famous (in my eyes) for employing <a href="http://www.splorp.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Hutchinson</a>.<br>
<br>
Dolly is &ldquo;a book typeface with fluorishes&rdquo;.&nbsp; I love book
typefaces, and every time I read a book I spend about as much time
admiring the letterforms as I do reading the actual content.<br>
<br>
Incognito is based on the fancy writing of old maps.&nbsp; When I was a
child I would peer into maps endlessly.&nbsp; The best part about this
font is that each capital has a swash variant that goes in one of four
different directions, named after the Latin for North, East, South, and
West.&nbsp; Very elegant, albeit a bit overused in their type specimens.<br></p>

			 <p>I realize what I&rsquo;ve been missing from Oklahoma.<br>
<br>
The smell of the air at night after a hot day.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t describe
it, but it&rsquo;s so crisp and rich and at the same time not at all thick.<br>
<br>
And I also miss being able to see at night because the businesses keep
their lights on in the parking lots.&nbsp; The light pollution in
Oklahoma City is incredible.&nbsp; When you drive towards Oklahoma City
at night, you can see the entire horizon lit up from tens of miles away.<br>
<br>
We watched <em>Loser</em> at Meredith&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The movie is cute and well-made.&nbsp; It reminded me of summer in New York last year.<br>
<br>
My girlfriend is really wonderful.&nbsp; She came over to Olin while I
was packing and kept me company even when it was about the most boring
thing ever.&nbsp; Never once complained even if I had to run off for an
hour or two to go put stuff in storage while she waited and napped on a
bed without sheets on it in the bright light while Dan also packed.<br></p>

			 <p>Time for a couple of updates from the Grant Hutchins camp.<br>
<br>
First off, I&rsquo;ve started a new blog, <a href="http://grantstake.blogspot.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant&rsquo;s Take</a>,
where I will post my skeptical analysis of articles that I read.&nbsp;
I have no agenda other than the new blog&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;Question everything
you read.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Second off, I just put the finishing touches on the three latest games on my <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/bowling.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Bowls!</a> page.&nbsp; I have a new personal best!<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, I randomly searched my name using <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Suggest</a> today.&nbsp; It turns out that as you type Grant Hutchins, the form autocompletes with &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?complete=1&amp;hl=en&amp;q=grant+hutchins+millionaire&amp;btnG=Google+Search" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">grant hutchins millionaire</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp; I guess enough people have searched me looking perhaps for the video.&nbsp; E-mail me if you want the link.<br>
<br>
The second hit I got was my recent mention in Prism, the American
Society for Engineering Education&rsquo;s monthly journal.&nbsp; I highly
doubt that being on a has-been television show is some of the biggest
engineering education news for April (especially considering the show
aired the beginnning of February) but who&rsquo;s counting?<br>
<br>
I still don&rsquo;t have a job but I&rsquo;m trying several different ways to get
the attention of employers.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t been outright rejected yet,
but I&rsquo;ve only received one actual offer, not really for a job but
instead for volunteer work to do a new PBS show&rsquo;s website.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not really sure if doing that would be a horrible waste of my time or a
great resume builder.<br>
<br>

			 <p>Well it looks like you found this blog somehow.  Welcome!<br /><br />My plan is to take everyday news articles and deconstruct them from a skeptical perspective. The general mission is “Question everything you read.” I will look at the way that reporters present messages in their writing and point out the questions I would ask the reporter if I was in a conversation.<br /><br />Posting will be irregular.<br /><br />This page was inspired by recent discussions about my skepticism and by an <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/050502/2sick.htm">article I read in U.S. News and World Report</a> about “prediagnosing” illnesses before they actually show up in a person.<br /><br />Katherine Hobson starts:<br /><blockquote><span>O</span>ne fall day in 2003, more than 20 million Americans went to bed healthy and woke up sick. They didn&rsquo;t feel any different—no 24-hour stomach virus, no late-fall cold. What happened? An international committee published new guidelines for declaring someone “prediabetic”—that is, at increased risk of developing diabetes. Overnight, people who had never considered themselves sick were being told by their doctors that they had a medical problem. “Here are people who have been mostly doing what I asked—they&rsquo;ve been keeping their weight under control, exercising, and keeping their blood sugar levels constant, which is a good thing,” says Jenni Levy, a primary-care physician in Bethlehem, Pa. “But now I had to say that this is now abnormal. You have not changed, your blood sugar hasn&rsquo;t changed, but the rules have changed.”</blockquote>Now when I read this, all I could think of was why don&rsquo;t they come out and say which international committee published these guidelines? Certainly doctors don&rsquo;t change their prognoses overnight. These messages take time to percolate through the diverse medical community, and I would imagine a great number of doctors would take such a study with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Certainly the role of doctor involves giving the best care your patients could possibly get, but doctors make up a social group that involves a lot of give and take. One paper, regardless of the committee that publishes it, could never be expected to change the face of medicine and have the impact this opening paragraph might have you think.<br /><br />So there you have it.  Perhaps a minor point to make, but still a valid one in my opinion.  What do you think?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ten years ago on this day I sat working on an assignment for my math
class.&nbsp; I had tested out of a chapter of work and was working by
myself on a project to present to the class.<br>
<br>
Sitting in the independent project classroom, we felt the building
shake.&nbsp; At first the teacher told us it was probably a sonic
boom.&nbsp; She used to live near an air force base, and recently on
the news people had talked about the possibility of stationing B2
stealth bombers at Tinker Air Force Base.&nbsp; I thought it could have
been an earthquake.<br>
<br>
We looked out the window and saw a plume of smoke, like a brush fire, about 10 miles away.<br>
<br>
Around 9:00 am on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh drove a Ryder truck
full of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and nitromethane racing fuel in
front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma
City.&nbsp; At 9:02 am the truck detonated, ultimately killing 168
people, from ATF agents to children in a daycare center.&nbsp; At the
time it was by far the largest terrorist attack on American soil, and
to this day it remains the largest domestic terrorist attack.&nbsp; The
death toll came out to approximately 13 times that of Columbine, the
school shooting that would take place exactly four years and one day
later.<br>
<br>
Reports came back to school slowly.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t really know what
was going on, but over time it became clear that it wasn&rsquo;t
normal.&nbsp; Some students were told that their parents were OK.&nbsp;
Something had happened downtown, and everyone was waiting on more
information.<br>
<br>
My mom ran outside, thinking that a plane had exploded in the
air.&nbsp; She had her window open and could hear the blast from 15
miles away.&nbsp; She later went to the local Wal-Mart and saw a
photographer run in to get pictures developed.&nbsp; They need to get
developed now!&nbsp; They need to get to the media&hellip;<br>
<br>
That day was the first day my aunt was to do court reporting for a
federal trial, instead of the local and state trials she had been doing
before.&nbsp; She sat in court in the Federal Courthouse, immediately
behind the Murrah building, certainly on the side one would rather be
on.&nbsp; Her cassette tape recording of the trial caught the blare of
an enormous explosion, following by frantic voices and the judge
ordering everyone to immediately leave the building because a bomb had
gone off.<br>
<br>
When I got home CNN was showing the same thing as the local news, and
every other channel for that matter.&nbsp; Bulletins were put out for
&ldquo;middle eastern terrorists&rdquo; that never panned out.&nbsp; A white
supremacist Gulf War veteran named Timothy McVeigh was arrested for
excessive speeding going north on I-35, away from the blast.<br>
<br>
Once everyone figured out that it was a truck bomb, and the dust
settled, people began the rescue effort.&nbsp; From all over the
country, and indeed the world, firefighters, police, medical personnel,
and volunteers poured in to help.&nbsp; Some of these officials would
later die in the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center.&nbsp;
Robots were used to dig through the rubble in the hopes of finding
survivors.&nbsp; After a few days, these hopes were dashed and families
had to admit defeat.<br>
<br>
On Thursday, my parents took me and my brothers downtown to catch a
glimpse.&nbsp; We weren&rsquo;t going to get close, just get within
eyeshot.&nbsp; It was a media circus.&nbsp; It seemed like every local
news station in America had a van parked there.&nbsp; Police lines were
everywhere, blocking square miles of downtown.&nbsp; Some extra line
was hanging off of a tree and I cut off a piece of it, which I have to
this day.&nbsp; You could see the damage clearly from a mile
away.&nbsp; The mood was somber and quiet and people were moving about
matter-of-factly.<br>
<br>
A week later, once all hope was lost, and to further protect the
immediate area by preventing an imminent collapse, the Murrah buidling
was imploded and cleared away.<br>
<br>
April 19.&nbsp; The date doesn&rsquo;t mean much outside of Oklahoma, but
there it automatically means the bombing.&nbsp; A nameless federal
building housing seemingly unrelated federal offices that I had never
heard of was attacked by a man who wanted to avenge the botched siege
by federal agents of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, TX, two years
earlier.<br>
<br>
No one really knew why Oklahoma City should be a target.&nbsp; Everyone
in the nation started talking about the &ldquo;heartland&rdquo;.&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/OKC/facts/Bombing/Terror5-4/index.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">terror in the heartland</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Where you&rsquo;d least expect it.&nbsp; The
governor of Oklahoma was on national television constantly, and each
day the police would report to the public the updated tally of those
who had died.&nbsp; It ended at 168.<br>
<br>
Months later, the State of Ohio donated some trees to plant at the
State Capitol, one each for the people who died.&nbsp; I was a Boy
Scout, in Troop 78, and I volunteered that day.&nbsp; I was up on stage
during the dedication holding the Oklahoma flag up so that it wouldn&rsquo;t
fall over in the wind.&nbsp; That was the first and only time that I
heard the names of those killed read aloud.&nbsp; It took about 45
minutes.&nbsp; Many if not most of the survivors were there, as well as
families, planting trees for the people they knew and loved.<br>
<br>
Just over six years later, terrorists attacked four planes, New York
City, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Perhaps the worst part
about that day was knowing how it would play out, what the aftermath
would be.&nbsp; First off, remember the date, September 11, we&rsquo;ll be
hearing about this for some time, just like April 19.&nbsp; Second,
there will be a relief effort.&nbsp; People will come from all over to
dig through the rubble in order to find survivors.&nbsp; Third, the
time will come where no one could be expected to live under this
rubble.&nbsp; People will still want to search, but they need to stop
sometime.&nbsp; People will fight to keep looking, but realistically
it&rsquo;s already too late.&nbsp; And there will be a few key images that
people remember.<br>
<br>
For Oklahoma City, it is usually the firefighter holding the baby, who would die in the next day or so.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ten years later, things are going a lot better in Oklahoma City.&nbsp;
The other day we were featured on the front page of the B section of
the Wall Street Journal in a glowing article talking about the urban
development, increased tourism, and how well the city had moved past
the stigma of being a victim.<br>

			 <p><P>Hello everyone.</P>
<P>I&rsquo;m in Oklahoma City, about to head back to Boston.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get to see too many people this time around, because I was only here for three non-flight days!</P>
<P>American Airlines cancelled my reservation because the lady at Chicago didn&rsquo;t scan my ticket when I got on my flight, so they bumped me to a later one.&nbsp; What a bunch of hoodlums.</P>
<P>Other than that, I went dogsledding last weekend.</P>
<P><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy/7479631/" title="Carrie and I prepare for dogsledding"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6/7479631_b8df68cffc_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Carrie and I prepare for dogsledding"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></P>
<P>That&rsquo;s me on the right in the ridiculous sunglasses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy/7479632/" title="The dogsled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6/7479632_46b81c32ad_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="The dogsled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></P>
<P>We&rsquo;re on a frozen lake in Maine.&nbsp; We slept outside on the lake itself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy/7479633/" title="Carrie and one of the sled dogs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6/7479633_b583ff42c8_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Carrie and one of the sled dogs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></A> </P>
<P>Here&rsquo;s one of the dogs (and Carrie too).&nbsp; The dogs obsessively pull when you put them on a leash.&nbsp; They are certainly bred for pulling sleds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yesterday I bowled the best game of my life, a 162.&nbsp; My dad didn&rsquo;t beat it, but his three-game series still won.</P>
<P>Anyway, I&rsquo;m gonna go back to waiting for my new flight.</P></p>

			 <p>My streak ended.&nbsp; No, not <em>that</em> streak.&nbsp; Maybe later for that one.<br>
<br>
But anyway I forgot to post last night.&nbsp; Yesterday I went shopping
for some major school supplies, on the halfway day of the semester!<br>
<br>
I also had my first 8 am class, which was wonderful!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so excited about complex numbers.&nbsp; I simply adore them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I went to the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/library/special_collections/index.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">special collections</a>
at the library of Harvard&rsquo;s Graduate School of Design.&nbsp; Before we
got into the library, we saw the best working environment I&rsquo;ve seen in
my life, a giant stairway of desks where people design
architecture.&nbsp; Imagine a grand staircase of open cubicles, with
the newbies on the bottom and the PhD&rsquo;s on top.&nbsp; After we went
into the library we saw a ton of stuff, such as hand-drawn plans for
the St. Louis Arch and Gropius&rsquo;s clipboard.&nbsp; I held <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Walter_Gropius.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gropius</a>&rsquo;s
clipboard.&nbsp; I simply love clipboards!&nbsp; I bought another one
at Staples today so that if I lose my current clippy I don&rsquo;t have to
fall behind in my classes!<br>
<br>
And today I went to parties at Wellesley and briefly at Babson.&nbsp; Had a lot of fun.<br></p>

			 <p>Quick post to keep my streak alive&hellip;<br>
<br>
I have an 8:00 am class today!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 3:52 am so I better run off to sleep.<br>
<br>
Yesterday was extremely busy, but worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day!<br></p>

			 <p>Today is my Xanga&rsquo;s 250th day.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;quarter mille&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
I finally did my laundry today.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been keeping myself busy enough that I have been way behind.<br>
<br>
For my student government position I often administer surveys to
various groups of students.&nbsp; The other day I made three different
mockups of a single survey I&rsquo;m about to give to the entire student
body.&nbsp; I presented these mockups to my Human Factors: Interface
Design class to let the students test them out.&nbsp; I learned quite a
lot from the process, and now I think the survey should be quite easy
to take (once I implement the best suggestions from the class).<br>
<br>
This monday, the Data Destruction Tour is coming to Boston.&nbsp; The
Data Destruction Tour is the only tour I know of that specializes in
the tiny little subgenre of music known as lofi or 8bit or chiptunes or
gamemusic or about a million other things.&nbsp; The idea is to use
1980s computer technology or video game systems or similar sounding
synthesis techniques to make music.&nbsp; Hear some at <a href="http://www.micromusic.net" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">micromusic.net</a>.&nbsp;
I have considered burning a few CDs of a some songs I have written in
this style and giving them around to the people involved to sorta jab
myself into the scene a bit.<br>
<br>
From a micromusic.com email:<blockquote>Mar 14th 2005 Data Destruction Tour 2005<br>
artists: Nullsleep, Bit Shifter, Covox<br>
venue: The Enormous Room, 567 Massachusetts Ave., Boston, MA, USA<br>

			 <p>I wonder if it will be a snow day.&nbsp; The weather is completely
horrible and miserable.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s a snow day, it will have no
impact on me, however, because I have no classes on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
A snow day on any other day would help me catch up so much, but a Wednesday snow day does nothing for me.<br>
<br>
I say &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not too far behind on things.&nbsp; I
certainly have a lot going on, but when I sit down and think about it,
they are moving along fine.&nbsp; Some of my things could use some more
enthusiasm, and the occasional jolt back into action, but really I am
on top of most stuff right now.<br>
<br>
We made a transistor radio in Analog and Digital Communications,
hard-tuned to WEEI 850 AM sports radio.&nbsp; The class is really
starting to make a lot more sense these days.&nbsp; It only makes me
wish I could spend more time designing circuits or software for
processing audio.&nbsp; Designing audio filters, in hardware or in
software, is one of my favorite activities.&nbsp; Luckily, I&rsquo;m majoring
in the right thing, Electrical and Computer Engineering.<br></p>

			 <p>Grant: &ldquo;Why is J. Lo a popular singer?&rdquo;<br>
Dan: &ldquo;Cause she&rsquo;s got a nice ass.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Wow, thanks Dan.&nbsp; Really classy.&nbsp; That wasn&rsquo;t what I
meant.&nbsp; Jennifer Lopez has an annoying nasal voice.&nbsp; Her
latest song has an annoying sax line.&nbsp; I&hellip; secretly wish that I
didn&rsquo;t like it in a disturbing way.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m going <a href="http://www.mahoosuc.com/dogs.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">dogsledding</a> for the first weekend of Spring Break up in Maine.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.gordonsguide.com/dog-sledding/mahoosucguideservice/images/14096_lg.jpg"><br>
<br>
I came up with a new way to make my todo list.&nbsp; I put todo items
up on Post-It notes on my wall.&nbsp; The higher notes represent more
important things I need to do, like get a job for summer.&nbsp; The
bottom notes are not important, such as fixing my digital camera.&nbsp;
That way I still see everything I have to do, but I don&rsquo;t forget the
important stuff.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you how it goes.&nbsp; I think this
will finally be the method I keep.<br>
<br>
Today I stopped doing things for an hour.&nbsp; It was splendid.&nbsp;
Since last Thursday, I hadn&rsquo;t stopped for even ten minutes.&nbsp;
Constant activity, moving from class to party to class to meeting to
meeting to the candidate&rsquo;s weekend and back again.&nbsp; Finally I can
get some sleep.<br>
<br>
Starting this Friday I will have an 8 am class, Complex
Variables.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m actually really excited about Complex
Variables.&nbsp; They really come in handy for messing with audio
signals.&nbsp; But anyway this means that my first classes each day
will look like this:<br>
<br>
Monday 2 PM<br>
Tuesday 8 AM<br>
Wednesday (no class, nothing until CORe meeting at 6:30 PM)<br>
Thursday 2 PM<br>
Friday 8 AM<br>
<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t get any weirder than that.<br>
<br>
Also, elections are going to be soon for CORe (The Council of Olin
Representatives), so I will sadly give up my post as Vice Presdient of
Communication.&nbsp; I might run for another executive position, but I
haven&rsquo;t decided yet.&nbsp; The CORe Digest is my baby!&nbsp; I will
miss it!<br></p>

			 <p>Someone needs to tell Google that their stuff isn&rsquo;t in beta
anymore.&nbsp; Napster killed that word forever, and now Google is
desecrating its coffin.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in a slump, as I have, then clean up your
room!&nbsp; It does wonders for the psyche!&nbsp; Throw away lots of
stuff.<br>
<br>
Tucker IMed me today and we talked through some programming issues on
our software synthesizer.&nbsp; Good news!&nbsp; It works on my
computer for the first time!&nbsp; Now we can finish up the GUI and we
will have a product that is ready for real-world beta testing!&nbsp;
Keep posted.<br>

<br>
Yesterday my professor didn&rsquo;t show up for my class
Synchronization.&nbsp; There are 6 students in the class, but only 5
showed up.&nbsp; We waited for a bit and then one of the staff came in
and told us the professor wasn&rsquo;t coming.&nbsp; We then spent the entire
remainder of the class period going over the homework, writing stuff up
on the board, and debating it.<br>
<br>
I love this school.&nbsp; The subject matter is interesting enough that we don&rsquo;t even need a professor to hold class!<br></p>

			 <p>Back to blogging!&nbsp; A lot of people are getting involved on the Olin College blogring these days.<br>
<br>
We just had the first Candidate&rsquo;s Weekend of the year.&nbsp; It went
very well.&nbsp; The students are getting inspired again to be at Olin.<br>
<br>
Today I put a bunch of pictures up on flickr.&nbsp; Just go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy">http://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy</a></a> for more.<br>
<br>
Today the rest of the CORe E-Board and I went to the senior
administration meeting for Olin.&nbsp; We gave student feedback to the
President, VPs, and heads of various departments.&nbsp; I think it went
well.&nbsp; I got to learn a lot of details about running a new school.<br>
<br>
I got my camera back today in the mail.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d left it in Drew&rsquo;s car
in LA.&nbsp; It reminds me of all my broken items.&nbsp; My camera&rsquo;s
flash doesn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; My palm&rsquo;s screen doesn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; My next
palm&rsquo;s screen cracked.&nbsp; The face broke off of my nice watch.&nbsp;
If only I weren&rsquo;t so lazy I would fix them all.<br>
<br>
Now all I really need is a summer job.&nbsp; A nice internship.&nbsp; I
have some wonderful contacts lined up so I guess I should start asking
them for advice.<br>
<br>
The new Chemical Brothers album, <em>Push the Button</em>, is
very nice.&nbsp; I like the first two tracks best, &ldquo;Galvanize&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Boxer&rdquo;.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like &ldquo;Galvanize&rdquo; the first time I heard it, or
even the second, but now it&rsquo;s one of my all-time favorite Chemical
Brothers songs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s interesting to note that I also didn&rsquo;t like
&ldquo;Block Rockin&rsquo; Beats&rdquo; the first few times I heard it.&nbsp; I still
haven&rsquo;t figured out how the Chemical Brothers are able to evoke this
initial disinterest.<br>
<br>
Well I shall try to get into a better habit of posting on here.<br></p>

			 <p>Hello everyone.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been too long since I&rsquo;ve posted.&nbsp; The
next installment of the Innermost Cabin stories is &ldquo;Not a True Story&rdquo;.&nbsp; Enjoy.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m about to embark tomorrow morning on a grand trip from Oklahoma City
to Los Angeles, for 22 hours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going with Drew, who lives out
there with my friend Jon.&nbsp; I will be flying back to Oklahoma City
on the 18th.&nbsp; I hope to bump into as many people in LA as I
can.&nbsp; I went last year but only knew three people from LA.&nbsp;
This year I know at least ten.<br>
<br>
Other than that I&rsquo;ve been reading <i>V.</i> by Thomas Pynchon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve finished <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>
and will then move on to <span style="font-style: italic;">Mason &amp; Dixon</span> before tackling the
grand-daddy Pynchon book of all time, <i>Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow</i>.&nbsp; Wish me
luck, this is not an easy task.<br>
<br>
Austin and I continue our work on Gamecube games.&nbsp; I have ordered
the hardware that will allow me to load my code from an SD card, so
everyone at Olin will finally get to see Snowlords in action!<br>
<br>
Other than that I applied to some jobs at The MathWorks and
Apple.&nbsp; I will apply to some less ambitious places too so that I
don&rsquo;t yet again come up empty-handed.<br>
<br>
My next computer will be a Mac, perhaps a G5 tower.&nbsp; Mmm.<br><blockquote> &ldquo;Not a True Story&rdquo;<br>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m back in Oklahoma City for Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
Last night I went to Rima&rsquo;s birthday party and saw some old
faces.&nbsp; Afterwards we watched Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie,
and I believe I was the only person to laugh at the fact that the
boss&rsquo;s name is Eugene Krabs.&nbsp; Eugene Krebs was a perrennial
Socialist presidential candidate back around the 1920s.<br>
<br>
Today we had early Thanksgiving in Enid.&nbsp; We had some good
lasagna.&nbsp; Also, my grandfather gave us his 1985 Toyota Camry,
which hit exactly 100,000 miles on the drive home.&nbsp; I am
considering taking it up to Boston, but it&rsquo;s not looking too up to that
task as of now.<br>
<br>
Time for part two of the Innermost Cabin series.<br>
<br><blockquote>Nature<br>
Greg Miller<br>
no date<br>
<br>
The cabin is great, small, warm, quite, and peacefull. The trails long
and <u>spooky</u>! nature just singing birds, the ruffles of the water the
trees swaying back and forth, the wind blowing, deer running, and frogs
jumping from lilypad to lilypad. Nature is great. Till the one eyed
deer hunts you down and craps on you. So be aware of the dunt dunt
dunnnnn the One Eyed Deer<br></blockquote></p>

			 <p>Sorry I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while.&nbsp; To tide things over, I&rsquo;m going
to start posting some of the Stories from Innermost Cabin.&nbsp;
Freshman year, 4 of us stayed at the <a href="http://www321.pair.com/oaries/localattitude/innermost.htm" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innermost Cabin</a>
at the Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary.&nbsp; In the guestbook, we
found a bunch of stories written by schoolchildren that had stayed
before us.<br>
<br>
Now, get ready for the first installment, &ldquo;The Coyote Man&rdquo;<br>
<br><blockquote>2/23/01<br>
Greg Miller<br>
The Coyote Man<br>
<br>
Walking down the icy path to get to the cabin I saw a coyote but it
didn&rsquo;t look like one eather, and then I saw it a Coyote Man we were all
scared to death, so we ran to the cabin, we were safe. When we got to
the cabin me and my friend Justin wrote in the Jurnels and and Started
to make a fire. Then we started to burn up from the fire so we took a
walk out to the bathrooms to cool off a little and then it Happend
Coyote Man jumped out and pit a piece of Justin&rsquo;s arm then Justin got
eatin It was grose. I was running realy fast to get to the babin then
Justin&rsquo;s dad tripped and Coyote Man eat the whole half of his body now
I was scared. Walking down the path hearing footsteps all the Sudden it
happend Coyote Man bit my head right off.</blockquote></p>

			 <p>Hello everyone.<br>
<br>
So it&rsquo;s been awhile since my last update.<br>
<br>
No photos today.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve taken a lot in these last ten days or so, but those will come later.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m back home in Oklahoma now.&nbsp; Nothing much going on here.&nbsp;
In fact, I&rsquo;ve seen much fewer people than I usually would have since
I&rsquo;ve gotten back.<br>
<br>
Last weekend I stayed with my roommate Dan at his house in Somerville,
Massachusetts.&nbsp; On the days while everyone was working at their
internships, I wandered down Highland Ave. near Davis Square and
snapped a ton of pictures of typical Americana.<br>
<br>
While in the Boston area, Dan, Tommy, and I went to the Skellig bar in
Waltham and competed in the trivia contest.&nbsp; We started strong,
but ended with a fairly miserable showing, coming in dead last.&nbsp;
One round left us with zero points earned.&nbsp; Unfortunately we will
be unable to show them what we really are capable of because Dan and I
will have a Mathematical Analysis class in which we will prove the
calculus from scratch on Mondays from 9:30 to 11:30 pm this
semester.&nbsp; What better way to pass the time.<br>
<br>
I started and finished Fermat&rsquo;s Enigma, a book on solving the most
famous mathematical problem of the last few centuries, Fermat&rsquo;s Last
Theorem.&nbsp; Since then I&rsquo;ve completed the first four chapters of the
9/11 Commission Report.<br>
<br>
The last few nights have seen countless hours spent on trying to get
multiplayer Red Alert, Red Alert 2, Quake II, Quake III, or Warcraft
III working properly.&nbsp; Our best successes have been
cross-platform, ironically.<br>
<br>
I will take a picture of my family&rsquo;s new poker chips for the next post.<br></p>

			 <p>Last Wednesday Cagle and her friend Erin came from Alabama to visit for three days.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/aee242fcda.jpg" alt="Erin and cagle" title="erin_and_cagle.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
We wandered around the Big Apple and hit a lot of cool shops in
Greenwich Village, where I snagged some good vinyl and a really cheap&nbsp;
hardcover
copy of Thomas Pynchon&rsquo;s <i>Mason and Dixon</i> to add to my to-read list.<br>
<br>
I found this picture on the wall at Famiglia&rsquo;s Pizza, a nice New York pizza joint.&nbsp; My brother will appreciate it.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ee60f26394.jpg" alt="American ninja" title="american_ninja.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
Tucker, Cagle, Erin, and I went to <a href="http://www.mrchocolate.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacques Torres&rsquo;s chocolatier</a> in Brooklyn for my third time.&nbsp; I found these chocolate sculptures in the back room:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/2a888bf03c.jpg" alt="Chocolate sculptures" title="chocolate_sculptures.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
We walked back over the Brooklyn Bridge, for my fourth time.&nbsp; I
found this spray-painted into the concrete of the bridge walkway.&nbsp;
I hate it when people spray paint messages on stuff using
stencils.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s tacky and rude, but at least in this particular
case it supports my political cause, albeit to an extreme.<br>
<br>

We ran into a b-boy posse breakdancing for the crowd later that day.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/984751eba1.jpg" alt="Breakdancers" title="breakdancers.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
The next day we ran into a large group of firefighters and police
unexplainedly axing their way into a Borders bookstore which otherwise
seemed fine.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/870b4bdfc5.jpg" alt="Firefighters" title="firefighters.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
We ate at a nice little Greek restaurant in the Village, and I ordered
pastichio, a traditional Greek dish that my mother and grandmother make
every once in a while since my grandfather has full Greek blood.&nbsp;
The pastichio was excellent, the salad was wonderful in its feta glory,
and the baklava was just what I like, proving that I do indeed have
Greek blood running in my veins.<br>
<br>
On Saturday after the two girls left Tucker, Mara, and I went kayaking
in the Hudson River.&nbsp; If you go to the end of Riverside Park by
72nd Street, they have a little platform set up where you can hop on a
kayak for free for up to 20 minutes, or up to 2 hours on Fridays.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/a38e2e1ea3.jpg" alt="Kayaking" title="kayaking.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
The journey offered a wonderful view of Manhattan, dominated in this particular area by a series of Trump condominium buildings.<br>
<br>
Dan drove down from Boston later that day and stayed the night.&nbsp;
We ran around town some more and ended up in Hoboken, NJ, for my final
trip to visit Emily at Stevens.&nbsp; Dan grabbed some of my belongings
to help me in my upcoming move to Boston for the weekend before my
flight home next Wednesday.<br>
<br>
On the way back from work on Monday, Tucker and I ran into a strange sight:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/014b7eb97c.jpg" alt="Bird remains" title="bird_remains.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
Sorry for the gruesome imagery, but whatever got to this bird left the
wings and only the wings entirely intact.&nbsp; Very strange.<br>
<br>
Today Tucker, Mara, and I ate at an Afghanistan restaurant.&nbsp; I
loved it!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t expect to, since I had nothing to base
expectations on.&nbsp; I am now convinced that orange rind should be
put into every dish.<br>
<br>
After putting in a little more work on the synth, Mara and I watched a
bootleg copy of Fahrenheit 9/11, which I found to be suprisingly devoid
of any real argument or fresh, important details about its title
disaster.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend the 9/11 Commission Report for anyone who wants a
serious look into the reality of the situation.&nbsp; You can grab a
recording of an executive summary free on iTunes right now.&nbsp; I
much prefer to read it, however, and want to buy a copy sometime
soon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s now on my <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/registry/1008QKA0SYJDG" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon wish list</a>.&nbsp; Go be curious and poke around on it if you like.<br></p>

			 <p>My luck continues to rise.&nbsp; When I walked home from work today I
found a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer with 61-key keyboard lying against a
trash can to be thrown out.&nbsp; I snagged it and left a note behind
in case the person didn&rsquo;t mean to throw it out.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9247b7377a.jpg" alt="Yamaha dx7" title="yamaha_dx7.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
However, the state of the keyboard suggests it was ready to be thrown out.&nbsp; For example, the power cable has come loose.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/545fde2549.jpg" alt="Dx7 broken wire" title="dx7_broken_wire.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
I am an electrical engineer, so this does not faze me in the
slightest.&nbsp; Soon I will grab a soldering iron and make it work to
the best of my abilities.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/79d3c125b0.jpg" alt="Dx7 front" title="dx7_front.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
The Yamaha DX7 was a popular synthesizer of the 1980s, and make a lot
of the defining sounds of eighties music.&nbsp; Its quality isn&rsquo;t
wonderful, from what I&rsquo;ve heard, but it&rsquo;s a synthesizer nonetheless and
I&rsquo;m sure I can find good uses for it, especially as a keyboard
controller for my computer music setup.<br>
<br>
After I had spent hours waiting in the rain to get tickets to the
Shakespeare in the Park show in Central Park, and after the rain fully
cleared up, they cancelled the show.&nbsp; However, before I got in
line for standby tickets, I did manage to snap some pictures of a
completely burnt car on the side of the road.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1006f43d68.jpg" alt="Burned car side" title="burned_car_side.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
The flames completely destroyed the interior, leaving a metallic shell.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/6cc301c3ed.jpg" alt="Burned car rear" title="burned_car_rear.jpg" border="0" width="360" height="480" /><br>
<br>
Today I ate dinner outside on patio seating at Max SoHa, a most
wonderful Italian restaurant less than a block from my apartment.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cfac4259fe.jpg" alt="Max soha" title="max_soha.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
The food is excellent and the atmosphere very comfortable and familial.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;SoHa&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;South of Harlem,&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ve similary named our startup synthesizer software company <a href="http://www.sohasound.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoHa Sound Design</a>,
in reference to where the development actually took place.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
hoping to finish up a release candidate of the final synthesizer by the
time I leave New York on August 11, and have a final 1.0 version ready
for sale a few weeks thereafter.<br>
<br>
Cagle and her friend come up to visit me for a few days on Wednesday
and Dan comes up on Saturday, so my week should be filled with plenty
of excitement.<br></p>

			 <p>Today I received a postcard from the daily version of Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire.&nbsp; They accepted me into the contestant pool and more
likely than not they will call me in the next month or two and give me
a tape date.&nbsp; The daily version has no Fastest Finger, so if I got
on I would be directly in the Hot Seat.<br>
<br>
The synth project goes well.&nbsp; We should have a final product ready
in a week or two.&nbsp; The last few days have been slow, but today
something clicked and both Tucker and I made incredibly impressive
progress.&nbsp; The sound quality has increased tremendously and our
product has a lot of potential, in my humble opinion.&nbsp; OK, maybe
it&rsquo;s not as humble as possible.<br>
<br>
The other day the entire ISE office went to Mama Mexico, a fairly good Mexican restaurant:<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/dd5eb26b8b.jpg" alt="Mama mexico" title="mama_mexico.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /><br>
<br>
My boss Chris is on the left.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gotten me hooked on the egg
and cheese sandwiches with Tabasco sauce that they sell on the street
corner by our office.&nbsp; It tastes better than it probably sounds.<br>
<br>
Lately, some of the workers in the office have been clearing out old
equipment and files to put in the dumpsters.&nbsp; I snapped a quick
pic of some vacuum tubes in one particularly old piece of equipment:<br>
<br>

<br>
The next book on my reading agenda is <span style="font-style: italic;">Mind at Light Speed: A New Kind of Intelligence</span>
by David D. Nolte.&nbsp; Every book I&rsquo;ve read this summer has tied into
cognition, how the senses work, or quantum theory.&nbsp; This book
manages to tie all three concepts together and draw even more links
between the variety of new things I&rsquo;ve learned about in prior
books.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m surprised how in what I thought was a seemingly random
assortment of books I have happened onto the same major concepts three
or four times now.<br>
<br>
I have now covered the paranoid angle, the medical angle, the artistic
angle, and finally the scientific angle of such things as neural
theory, quantum physics, and how we perceive images.<br>
<br>
I spent Monday in Hoboken, NJ, with my old friend Emily.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a
photographer so as soon as I got there we went to a shoot she had been
hired for.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/071a2ebba5.jpg" alt="Emily balcony" title="emily_balcony.jpg" border="0" width="360" height="480" /><br>
<br>
She captured the essence of a Wall Street entrepreneur&rsquo;s million dollar
apartment.&nbsp; I chatted him up on wine and travel and he predicts
that Argentina will be the next great wine producer in the next decade
or so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, we went to the Stevens Institute of Technology bowling
alley, and I rolled a series of three bowling games.&nbsp; Although I
threw some great balls, I tended to step over the foul line and this
particular alley made sure not to count two of my strikes and one seven
pin frame, so I didn&rsquo;t even break 100 on my first game.&nbsp; I plan on
going bowling more this school year.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow will be Shakespeare in the Park in Central Park (if we can get
tickets this time) and Saturday will be my second short story event at
Columbia.&nbsp; The short story events involve a bunch of people (who I
met through Tucker) collecting together and reading aloud their
favorite short stories.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simple, envigorating, and human to
listen to others tell stories.&nbsp; Lately, attendees have been
encouraged to write their own short stories to tell at the next
session.&nbsp; I might attempt to bring this concept to Olin.<br></p>

			 <p>I have spent the last few days with little social interaction.<br>
<br>
Today when my friend Mara came to my room I started blabbing about a
million different things, because I had saved up stuff to talk
about.&nbsp; I must have appeared quite manic.&nbsp; She seemed OK with
it though and manically spoke back so I guess it was fine.<br>
<br>
Over the course of the last two days I have decided that the world is starting to fall apart.&nbsp; Here is my evidence:<br>
<ul>
  <li>New Zealand, of all places, caught Israeli spies trying to
falsify their passports, and has starting cutting off a lot of the
diplomatic ties it has with Israel in response.</li>
  <li>The police in Palestinian cities have been doing nothing lately,
allowing anarchy to run rampant and leading to mob rule, as several of
Yasser Arafat&rsquo;s top deputies resign left and right.</li>
  <li>The Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, informed all Jews in
France that they &ldquo;must&rdquo; move to Israel to escape French anti-Semitism,
which supposedly is on the rise.&nbsp; France is not happy with these
statements.</li>
  <li>The 9/11 Commission is set to report that Iran was helpful to Al Qaeda prior to the September 11 attacks.</li>
  <li>Iran has halted the trial of an Iranian intelligence agent who
murdered an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist, tearing apart whatever
diplomatic relations the two nations held.</li>
</ul>
In addition, I have found myself reading all about Bobby Fischer,
perhaps the world&rsquo;s best chess player ever, and certainly the chess
world&rsquo;s most outspoken anti-Semitic anti-American reclusive
nutcase.&nbsp; Bobby Fischer praised the September 11 attacks on a
Philippines radio broadcast and went against a presidential order in
1992 to play a chess game in Yugoslavia.&nbsp; He was found the other
day at Narita International Airport in Japan and is in the process of
being extradited to the United States to stand trial.&nbsp; <a href="http://home.att.ne.jp/moon/fischer/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">His website</a> is a hilarious mish-mash of misplaced criticisms and paranoid banter.<br>
<br>
But they hauntingly reminded me of the website of a certain <a href="http://www.ishipress.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Sloan</a>.&nbsp; Here is a small list of similarities:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Both play chess incredibly well.</li>
  <li>Both have plaintext websites with gobs of links as to why they have been persecuted by forces all over the world.</li>
  <li>Both scan pictures of checks and all sorts of paper documents as evidence.</li>
  <li>Both completely reprint news articles to support their causes.</li>
  <li>Both attempt to completely libel individuals who they believe victimized them.</li>
  <li>Both have spent time in East Asia fleeing some type of authority figure.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
However, Sam Sloan is not a wanted criminal and is instead running for
the House of Representatives in the Bronx.&nbsp; He also is the last
person to have represented himself to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He won
his case 9-0.&nbsp; By the time the decision was rendered, it seems he
was in a prison in Afghanistan, which he escaped from soon thereafter.<br>
<br>
Anyway my current theory is that the &ldquo;savant syndrome&rdquo;, which I am reading about in my book <span style="font-style: italic;">Phantoms of the Brain </span>by
Ramachandran, is at play.&nbsp; Both of these men are great chess
minds,
yet both seem horribly paranoid, constantly reinvent their lives, and
proselytize their bizarre and specific views through verbose text-based
websites.&nbsp; Socially I think their lives are completely complex
messes, and yet they maintain a careful constant determination to
succeed in whatever they do above all.<br>
<br>
So, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been up to.<br>
<br>
On Saturday, after a failed attempt by Tucker and Mara to get us
Shakespeare in the Park&nbsp; tickets, I wandered alone through the
streets of the Morningside Heights district of Manhattan, between 123rd
and 110th Streets.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/40f9b6e5f8.jpg" alt="Mailbox liquor" title="mailbox_liquor.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">

<br>
</span>This view shows the red line of the subway as it becomes an
elevated train.&nbsp; I live on the street right where it comes
out.&nbsp; 122nd St. goes over the subway, 124th Street goes under the
elevated track, and 123rd St. runs right into the point of intersection
and abruptly ends.<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>

<br>
My weekend also involved a lot of reading.&nbsp; I finished the final half of the Ramachandran book and read some of <span style="font-style: italic;">Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing</span>,
which I borrowed from my Biology (and Art) professor Helen
Donis-Keller.&nbsp; This book ties right in with the Ramachandran book,
expanding on the cognition of seeing and applying it to the world of
art.<br>
<br>
I am enrolled in a three student course with Prof. Donis-Keller for
this fall semester called The Intersection of Art and Science.&nbsp;
Personally, I cannot wait.&nbsp; I have always obsessed over the senses
and the function of the brain, and the small size of the course means I
will get a good chance to explore with a lot of guidance from my
professor.&nbsp; I often disagree with her, both politically and
artistically at times, but appreciate her perspective because it often
catches me off guard and forces me to reconsider what I am doing.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow I go bowling in Hoboken, New Jersey.&nbsp; Soon I will have an update for the <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/bowling.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Bowls!</a> page of my sister site <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Page Central</a>,
which is in dire need of an update.&nbsp; My plan is to convert Grant
Page Central into a static content site of my musical works, some
writings, and of course bowling scores, while letting this page, Grant
Page X, be my blog.<br>

			 <p>Hello everyone.&nbsp; I have several important Grant updates for the last couple days.<br>
<br>
Last Tuesday, July 13, 2004, I went to the free Fountains of Wayne
concert at the World Financial Center downtown.&nbsp; The World
Financial Center is right across the street from the World Trade Center
site.&nbsp; I snapped this pic of the new WTC station that opened up
earlier this year:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/843791a1f6.jpg" alt="Wtc station" title="wtc_station.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
Anyway I made my way to the back side of the big huge indoor Winter
Garden at the WFC, where all sorts of people started crowding around
the stage outside.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/864c671d71.jpg" alt="Wfc fow show" title="wfc_fow_show.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
They played a good set and poked a little fun.&nbsp; At one point, the
lead singer changed around some lyrics to Radiation Vibe for old
diehard fans like me to pick up, since parents and kids made up the
majority of the audience due to the newfound recent success of their
latest album.&nbsp; They came out for a double encore, which now marks
the second time I&rsquo;ve seen them do a double encore, although both times
it seemed like they weren&rsquo;t planning to.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ddec2cf1b8.jpg" alt="Fountains of wayne" title="fountains_of_wayne.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t hear &ldquo;The Biker Song&rdquo; this time, but they
finally played it in the double encore, so this concert marks the first
time in a while that the band played every song I wanted to hear.&nbsp;
Hmm, well all except &ldquo;Troubled Times&rdquo; I guess.&nbsp; The band hails
from New Jersey, and many of their songs deal with places in New Jersey
or New York City, which made the show even better.&nbsp; My favorite
song by them right now, &ldquo;Sick Day&rdquo;, takes place on a PATH train from
New Jersey, so after the show I got them to sign my PATH Quick Card,
although they seemed confused at first as to the reference.&nbsp; On
top of that they seemed a little drunk and partially deaf,
unfortunately.<br>
<br>
The lead singer, Chris Collingwood said that he used to work in this building on the 35th floor (he&rsquo;s the one on the right):<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/858f98ec4c.jpg" alt="35th floor office" title="35th_floor_office.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
On Thursday I again tried out for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, the
daily version.&nbsp; This time I passed the test and got to the
interview process.&nbsp; They took a Polaroid of me and the interviewer
seemed pretty interested in several things that I had to say, so in
three or four weeks I will know if I am eligible to be on the show.<br>
<br>
After that, I met up with Leighton and we went to the lounge of the new
Mandarin Oriental hotel up on the 35th floor.&nbsp; Here was our view
of Central Park:<br><br><img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/5b24876ef2.jpg" alt="Central park from tw" title="central_park_from_tw.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
After that we had lunch at a wonderful restaurant called Eatery with
prices much lower than the quality of the food.&nbsp; After that we
went hotel lobby hopping and ended up at a really posh lobby at W Hotel
in Times Square and the incredible world&rsquo;s largest lobby at the New
York Marriott Marquis:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a613b2f46.jpg" alt="Nyc marriott" title="nyc_marriott.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
Yes, this picture was taken indoors.&nbsp; To give a little
perspective, those are balconies off of each floor which face down into
the atrium.&nbsp; Leighton took a business call, and I relaxed and
almost fell asleep:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/a9961c911a.jpg" alt="Leighton on phone" title="leighton_on_phone.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
After that I returned to the apartment and fell asleep for six
hours.&nbsp; I have ruined my daily schedule entirely, so now I&rsquo;m going
to go program some more for the software project Tucker and I work on
all the time.<br>
<br>
Ciao.<br></p>

			 <p>Saturday the fabled trip to Staten Island finally took place.&nbsp; We
hopped on the red line subway and transferred to the Staten Island
Ferry, a big free boat.<br>
<br>
Standing at the extreme front of the ship offered this view:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9589379b21.jpg" alt="Staten island ferry" title="staten_island_ferry.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
I have now seen both Statues of Liberty.&nbsp; After the French donated the statue, they erected a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Paris.seine.liberty.500pix.jpg" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">smaller copy</a> in Paris, which I saw by chance out of the side of a train car during my trip there two years ago.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving on Staten Island, we proceeded to the <a href="http://www.sibg.org/cg.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Chinese
Scholar&rsquo;s Garden</a>
at the Staten Island Botanical Garden.&nbsp; For everyone less familiar
with New York City, Staten Island makes up a large portion of New York
City, and is one of the five boroughs along with Manhattan, Queens, the
Bronx, and Brooklyn.&nbsp; Staten Island is mostly surburban as opposed
to the other boroughs, featuring malls instead of skyscrapers.<br>
<br>
However, the Chinese Scholars Garden, the first of its kind in the
United States, offered an escape from the trappings of city life:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/bfdbd17cff.jpg" alt="Garden statues" title="garden_statues.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
OK, this first picture wasn&rsquo;t from the Chinese Scholar Garden per se,
but instead from a smaller garden within the botanical garden.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/81652fa16e.jpg" alt="Garden courtyard" title="garden_courtyard.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
This mosaic was made by a traditional Chinese scholar garden artist who
uses materials around him.&nbsp; The white parts were rice bowls he
broke from the kitchen without asking and the green parts are Heineken
bottles.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cac8dd46e4.jpg" alt="Garden mosaic" title="garden_mosaic.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
We continued to a blatant &ldquo;secret&rdquo; garden, which was closed.&nbsp;
Since we had paid for admission, we felt it acceptable to hop onto the
wall and sit for awhile.&nbsp; As the photographer, I do not appear in
these photos.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/6442b2c541.jpg" alt="Secret garden wall" title="secret_garden_wall.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
Afterwards Tucker impressively hopped onto a nearby and somewhat inaccessible tree:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/3650e1d9a1.jpg" alt="Garden in tree" title="garden_in_tree.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
We ended the day by watching King Arthur, which not unlike Lord of the
Rings did not strike my fancy.&nbsp; I did manage to stay awake for
this one, fighting hard at times.&nbsp; I did enjoy the show for what
it was, but I could not suspend disbelief long enough to really care
about what was going on.<br>
<br>
Today at work during my lunch break a bird flew over and perched on my outside table in the rain:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/92af79597d.jpg" alt="Bird on table" title="bird_on_table.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
He rejected my offer of a small morsel of tomato (the red spot in the
picture), but violently grabbed Tucker&rsquo;s offering of a little piece of
bread and cheese and flew away fast enough that he could be sure we
couldn&rsquo;t reconsider.<br></p>

			 <p>Hello everyone.&nbsp; Today I didn&rsquo;t take any pictures, so I will pull some from my summer archives.<br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>On June 26, 2004, several other Olin students and I toured the city.&nbsp; I
snapped this picture of the Empire State Building while laying down on
the sidewalk:<br></p>

<p><br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/904dcab46b.jpg" alt="Empire state bldg" title="empire_state_bldg.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
On July 4, 2003, I found this abandoned building or parking garage in Brooklyn:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/071c967314.jpg" alt="Bklyn bldg" title="bklyn_bldg.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
The weather was beautiful today when I emerged from my apartment for the
first time at about 8:00 to eat Subway sandwiches at Grant&rsquo;s
Tomb.&nbsp; On the way to Subway, I passed the General Grant Houses,
which this picture from July 8, 2004, showcase in front of the elevated
subway train just south of 125th Street and Broadway:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8a4c64abc8.jpg" alt="General grant houses" title="general_grant_houses.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
Tucker and I cook many of our meals, including this Thai chicken dish
that Mara from downstairs helped us out with on June 16, 2004:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7f37723ef1.jpg" alt="Thai chicken" title="thai_chicken.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
Hopefully once the burners start burning again we will make some more
meals, but the cooking has slowed down considerably in recent weeks.<br>
<br>
Today I thought about how I don&rsquo;t watch much television and how many of
my hobbies involve creating things.&nbsp; I considered how much more
fulfilling I find life when I have something concrete to reflect on
from my past.<br>
<br>
My friend Jon often complains that he has trouble finding things to do
which don&rsquo;t involve &ldquo;consuming&rdquo;, be it food or media or just generally
spending money on useless things.&nbsp; He genuinely means what he&rsquo;s
saying, but more often than not he brings the concept up in a ploy to
get the gang to do something we never would have otherwise, from
inviting fifty people to a marshmallow roast in his backyard to Pong
tournaments (with commentary from the announcer, of course) to a
rousing game of croquet right before I left for New York City.<br>
<br>
So my charge unto you the reader is:&nbsp; go do something you haven&rsquo;t
done before.&nbsp; Make a kite and fly it.&nbsp; Go shopping for
antiques.&nbsp; See if bread really does land on the floor butter side
down every time.&nbsp; Plant some flowers.<br>
<br>
And please tell me what you did so that I can have more ideas.<br></p>

			 <p>To appease all of my kitchen ceiling&rsquo;s fans, presenting the final installment of the Kitchen Ceiling Chronicles:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/c7d1246922.jpg" alt="Fixed ceiling" title="fixed_ceiling.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
She&rsquo;s a beauty.&nbsp; The kitchen has returned to normal, except that
now the gas range and stove do not light themselves.&nbsp; Therefore,
we our celebratory tuna sandwiches went uncooked.&nbsp; However, all
was not lost.&nbsp; I discovered the new entry to our kitchen today, a
mirror nailed to a cabinet door:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/eeb8173feb.jpg" alt="Kitchen mirror" title="kitchen_mirror.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
This mirror reflects a style found throughout the apartment.<br>
<br>
Today I did laundry at B. Bubbles, Inc.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/19ad8557f6.jpg" alt="B bubbles" title="b.bubbles.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
While there, I snapped a picture of a man lugging far more cans down
the street than I could ever hope for, a commonplace occurrence in a big
city such as this one.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/2d713cf993.jpg" alt="Guy with cans" title="guy_with_cans.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
Today I finished a book I had borrowed from Tucker called <span style="font-style: italic;">The Evolution of Useful Things: How everyday artifacts—from forks and pins to paper clips and zippers—came to be as they are</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve finished two books so far this summer.&nbsp; The first was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crying of Lot 49</span>
by Thomas Pynchon, which I found very captivating, despite its immensely
obscure references and themes.&nbsp; One of my life goals is to finish
Pynchon&rsquo;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow</span>,
a most dense and unfriendly book which introduces ridiculous characters
nonstop and shoots around from the history of plastic to political
theory to differential equations to German folk songs often within one
sentence.<br>
<br>
But for now, the next book on my list is the Olin College summer reading, <span style="font-style: italic;">Phantoms in the Brain</span>,
by V.S. Ramachandran, M.D., Ph.D. and Sandra Blakeslee, a book
concerning cognitive syndromes and how they reveal insights into our
own mental functions.<br></p>

			 <p>Hello everyone.&nbsp; Time for the daily kitchen ceiling update.&nbsp;
My cell phone alarm did not go off because I had it set to &ldquo;Ringer
off&rdquo;.&nbsp; Personally I&rsquo;d rather have the alarm go off regardless of
the ringer setting.&nbsp; However, my late start this morning meant
that I was fifteen minutes late to work today, allowing me to witness
the arrival of three painters.&nbsp; Here is their ladder:<br>

<br>
The kitchen ceiling now looks like
this:<br>

<br>
Certainly not as nice as before but now the kitchen is usable again.&nbsp; Tomorrow we will make tuna sandwiches to celebrate.<br>
<br>
Here is my itinerary for next week:<br>
<br>
<br><table><tbody><tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Saturday, July 10, 2004<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The long-awaited trip to Staten Island might occur on this date if I push hard enough.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
<tr><td>Tuesday, July 13, 2004</td><td>Maybe I will
go see Fountains of Wayne play a free show.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s first-come
first-served, so I&rsquo;m not sure if I would be able to make it in time.</td></tr><tr><td>Thursday, July 15, 2004</td><td>My
second audition time for &ldquo;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&rdquo; will
hopefully see me get past the pre-test and get the interview.&nbsp; I
think I could kill in an interview, but maybe I&rsquo;m overconfident.</td></tr><tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Thursday, July 15, 2004</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">My roommate from this previous
year, Mr. Leighton Ige, will visit New York City for the day.&nbsp; We
will probably go catch dinner.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table><br>
On July 4, 2004, I found this stairway in a subway station:<br>

			 <p>Ceiling update:&nbsp; The waterproof latex paint that caught the water
and sagged down off of the ceiling has mysteriously disappeared,
leaving behind dripping scars.<br>

<br>
Other than that, a most uneventful day.&nbsp; I got a new assignment at
work, which will be my first PHP + MySQL web application ever.<br>
<br>
Some pigeons:<br>

			 <p>Hello everyone and welcome to New York City.<br>
<br>
You&rsquo;re on 123rd Street between Amsterdam and Broadway:<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/48a2fc45e6.jpg" alt="My building" title="my_building.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
You approach 522 W 123rd St., affectionately known as &ldquo;The Lorraine&rdquo;<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/2337ce6759.jpg" alt="The lorraine" title="the_lorraine.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
Why it&rsquo;s named The Lorraine I will never know.&nbsp; No other building
anywhere near has a name.&nbsp; After going up a couple flights of
stairs you find yourself in Apt. 3W and enter.<br>
<br>
You stop by the kitchen:<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/321801b055.jpg" alt="Sky is falling" title="sky_is_falling.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
You look up at the ceiling:<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/356fc8aab6.jpg" alt="Ceiling collapse" title="ceiling_collapse.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
You notice that something doesn&rsquo;t look right, and it&rsquo;s not just that
the light fixture is an uncovered power-saving fluorescent bulb that is
connected by thinly insulated wires which go right behind the
electrical sockets and are held to the side of the wall by metal screws
through the insulation which are painted white.&nbsp; Those bulbs are
in the other rooms.&nbsp; The kitchen has a problem all its own.<br></p>

			 <p>This morning I was awakened by two Chinese men asking me if I had a
&ldquo;twisted pair wire cutter thing&rdquo;, which meant an ethernet cable
crimper.&nbsp; One was the landlord and the other was the father of the
two high school kids who will be moving into our apartment.&nbsp; We
networked the entire house today.<br>
<br>
After that, Tucker baked some cookies using his old recipe from his mother.&nbsp; We noticed a large bulge in the ceiling.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/4c2bc1b6b5.jpg" alt="Bulge" title="bulge.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
Looks like a leak from the floor above somehow.&nbsp; Our apartment
used to be three bedrooms, but two of the bedrooms were split with
cheap fake walls, which were put right on top of the carpet.&nbsp;
Tucker slid a wire under the wall between our rooms when we wired the
house up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nice to know that we can slide things to each
other under the wall at any time.<br>
<br>
I had a great Fourth of July!&nbsp; I tagged along with Tucker and his
friends and went to DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge) to watch
purportedly the largest fireworks show in the nation.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/720ffcffd7.jpg" alt="Bklynfireworks" title="bklynfireworks.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="300" /><br>
<br>
You can see the Brooklyn Bridge right in front of the fireworks, which
were a couple miles from us just south of the tip of Manhattan.<br>
<br>
We were on some rocks right next to the Brooklyn-side pylon of the
Manhattan Bridge:<br>
<img src="https://nertzy.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fb103fa520.jpg" alt="Dumbo" title="dumbo.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="400" /><br>
<br>
The skyline looked like this:<br>

<br>
Today I downloaded Fahrenheit 9/11 after I read that <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/43167" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Moore
doesn&rsquo;t care if people pirate his movie</a>.&nbsp; I will watch it soon,
probably with my friend Mara from downstairs.&nbsp; I previewed the
first few minutes and found a lot of hype without a lot of argument, as
I expected.&nbsp; You can download <a href="http://66.90.75.92/suprnova/torrents/2042/Fahrenheit911.torrent" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> too, while supplies last. (UPDATE: you will need <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitTorrent </a>in order to download it, and this version is missing about 20 minutes concerning the Patriot Act)<br>
<br>
The only things I ate today were several of Tucker&rsquo;s cookies and a bowl of Chilled Gazpacho soup from <a href="http://www.josiesnyc.com/samples/index.html" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josie&rsquo;s</a>.&nbsp; Tomorrow might be another Taco Bell day.<br></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hello again everyone.&nbsp; I have just returned from Spiderman 2, and
I loved it.&nbsp; I am a big sucker for comic book movies.&nbsp; I read
a review today on Yahoo! Movies:<blockquote>
In a time when losers decide to profit off dead Americans and reek
propaganda unseen since the fall of the Soviets, comes a movie worth
every penny! A movie that assumes that we&rsquo;re not all brainless idiots!
However, just people looking for a solid sense of entertainment in
contrary to hidden issues masking political bloopers, infamous
outtakes, and puppetry of audience perception.</blockquote>So
as all of my more liberal friends groan, I want to touch on why I love
the concept of comic books and superheroes.&nbsp; I feel that the
classic characters, from Spiderman to Batman and everywhere in between,
represent a lot of what goes on in American life.&nbsp; Watching Peter
Parker not meet rent while I&rsquo;m paying rent for the first time, and
seeing him go around New York, my current home, and Columbia
University, my current employer, bring reality into such a fake movie.<br>
<br>
And one of the classic Spiderman messages is so uplifting in my
opinion.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that doing the right thing will get you
ahead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that being a superhero will make everyone love
you, or even give you self-confidence.&nbsp; The main message I heard
from the movie is to work, work, work.&nbsp; When you know what you&rsquo;re
doing is the right thing, work at it.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re not sure, keep
on working.&nbsp; Just get through it all and leave it better than you
found it.<br>
<br>
One of my favorite songs is The Noise of Carpet by Stereolab.&nbsp;
This song rocks way more than the remainder of their often-mellow,
always obscure fare.&nbsp; Somehow I love the mix of the unabashed guitar-driven music and the deadpanned yet quite firm lyrics:<br>
<blockquote>
                            i hate to see your broken face<br>
this world would give you anything<br>
as long as you will want to<br>
as long as you will want to<br>
i hate your state of hopelessness<br>
and that vain articulateness<br>
your loser type wreck wanna be<br>
not a pretty sight really<br>
in another world it&rsquo;d be funny<br><br>
i hate to see your broken face<br>
a lazy life of fatal waste<br>
of fashionable cynicism<br>
the poison they want you to drink<br>
oh no man that&rsquo;s too easy<br>
oh no man that&rsquo;s too easy<br>
we weren&rsquo;t talking bout happiness<br>
apply your leading potential<br>
to be useful to this planet<br>
the world would give you anything<br>
as long as you will want to<br>
as long as you will want to</p>

<p></blockquote>Some might see a few of those lines as being bitter.&nbsp;
Sure, they are, but what better thing to be bitter about than the
cynics who are not willing to work to improve their situation?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think cynicism is incredibly important in life,
but the next time you&rsquo;re down, just do something to make things better.</p>

			 <p>I told myself I would never stoop to such a level as having a website I didn&rsquo;t code myself.&nbsp; But then I succumbed.<br>
<br>
Dan told me that in order to have a good blog I can&rsquo;t just talk about
what I&rsquo;ve been up to.&nbsp; I need to talk about the ideas I&rsquo;m having
and try to make my blog something worth reading.&nbsp; Challenge
accepted.<br>
<br>
My first big idea:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried to eliminate my usage of
exclamation points recently.&nbsp; I realized that if what I&rsquo;m saying
needs an exclamation point in order to get its point across, I haven&rsquo;t
written it effectively.&nbsp; I often catch myself putting exclamation
points on every other sentence of emails I write, especially the CORe
Digest.&nbsp; I might leave them in for the CORe Digest since I&rsquo;m not
exactly going to take the trouble to strip them out by hand from what
people send me.<br>
<br>
If you&rsquo;re not from Olin you probably don&rsquo;t care one bit about the CORe
Digest.&nbsp; For the curious, I put out a weekly email newsletter to
the campus as part of my role on the student government.<br></p>

			 <p>Too much going on!</p>
<p>So far this week, I have slept through my business class, I
have prepared and performed PCR to sequence my own DNA, I have
been trained by an improv comedy professional, I have gone to a
class at an all-girls school, I have visited a sleep lab and
tried on equipment, I have given a presentation at the faculty
meeting, I have participated in a discussion about the entire
curriculum of my school, I have chatted at length with the CEO of
a small biotech company, and I have run a planning meeting for
the student politics organization of my school, of which I am the
president.</p>
<p>This school has to be the strangest place on Earth.</p>
<p>I should be working on my <a
href="http://ice.ece.olin.edu/">Circuits</a> lab to make white
noise, or writing an article for the <a
href="http://franklyspeaking.olin.edu/">school newspaper</a>, or
writing some reflections for <a
href="http://projects.olin.edu/fnd2610spring04/">Business</a>, or
for <a href="http://design.ece.olin.edu/sdp/">Design</a>, or I
could finally get around to declaring my major, which I decided
on years ago, or I could...</p>
<p>go to sleep.</p>
<p>And yes, this webpage does still exist.</p>

			 <p>BSE will live on!</p>
<p>BSE has one fewer member, as you may well have heard. Chris,
you will be missed, but we will keep in touch and the Chris
spirit will still be with us this semester. Stuff happens. <a
href="http://www.sluttering.org/monica/2003_03_23_archive.html">Time
is always a good thing.</a> Oh, and I'm in no way implying that
you are no longer part of BSE. The Best Semester Ever will live
on.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is my first <a
href="http://www.wellesley.edu/">Wellesley</a> class! I can't
wait to see the reaction of all the girls. This shall be
interesting.</p>
<p>I'm reading <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140268774/202-0625228-7434231">
The Double Helix</a></em> by James Watson, co-discoverer of the
double helix structure of DNA. Re-reading, that is. My Biology
class at Olin requires it, but so did my AP Biology class, so
I've read it before.</p>
<p>I just watched the Olin Challenge <a
href="http://www.olin.edu/media/StreamedChallenge.mov">PBS
spot</a> and I must say things have changed dramatically since
Partner Year. I'm listening to <a
href="http://www.zombienation.org/real/mp3/Zombie_Nation_Kernkraft_400_SI_RMX.MP3">
"Kernkraft 400"</a> by Zombie Nation. Man things have changed.
Right now I am in a nest of <a
href="http://www.h-quandt-stiftung.de/root/index.php?lang=en&amp;page_id=665">
social conflicts of interest</a>, but don't worry, I will take
each of my friends at <a
href="http://www.mindspring.com/~ninor/">face value</a> and well
consider why I ever became his or her friend in the first
place.</p>
<p>If this post sounds <a
href="http://www.museumoftalkingboards.com/cryptique.html">cryptic</a>,
that's because it is. Lately I feel like a changed man, ready to
<a
href="http://www.mndaily.com/daily/2000/07/17/sports/spo1/">take
on the world</a> and what it has available for me. I'll give you
a status report after this weekend.</p>

<p>This webpage is officially <em>back in action!</em> That's
right, <a href="http://iloveoregon.com/contact_us.htm">Brian</a>
and <a

this page is <a

over a new leaf</a> and providing <em>actual content</em>
starting right now!</p>
<p>I <a href="http://members.cox.net/nertzy/">wrote a Gamecube
game</a> with tkcne, also known as Austin. It is called Snowlords
and it is based on the Atari 2600 game Warlords. The release was
made official in #gcdev on EFNet and spread to websites such as
<a href="http://www.gcdev.com">gcdev.com</a> and <a
href="http://www.dextrose.com">dextrose.com</a>. Maybe one of
these days we'll get a screenshot. Today I <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Snowlords%22">searched
for Snowlords on Google</a> and found that there are two
different French-language sites featuring our game! Check them
out <a
href="http://www.gueux.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1977">
here</a> and <a
href="http://gc-hack.webheberg.com/homebrew.htm">here</a>! Each
has its own translation! A longer translation from the second
site can be found in <a

the Google cache</a>.</p>
<p>BSE stands for <a
href="http://passngstranj.diaryland.com/realdookey.html">Best
Semester Ever</a> and is the club that Dan, Chris, and I started.
It essentially involves getting out of Olin more often. I'll try
to keep up with pictures. We went to the <a
href="http://www.lovewhip.net">Lovewhip</a> show at Bill's Bar
and had a grand old time. Lovewhip features Olin's own AV
Technician Warren Jones (alias "<a
href="http://worldwidewojo.com/">Wojo</a>") on saxophone,
keyboards, and telephone rap. I earned the nickname "John
Travolta" over at <a href="http://www.olin.edu/it/">IT</a>.</p>
<p>My Wellesley class starts on Friday. I can't wait! I have
Cognition with visiting professor Jesse Hochstadt. It's in the
same room as Dan's Japanese class, and starts five minutes after
he is let out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.normalform.com/">Normalform</a> is back
up! Check out the new sections! Jon is leaning on my shoulder in
the <a
href="http://www.normalform.com/clothing/classicshirt.jpg">second
T-shirt pic</a>. You can see the "<a
href="http://no-treason.com/Freely/1.html">Do Something</a>" Olin
T-shirt's sleeve.</p>
<p>My sophomore design group will be researching people who
suffer from <a
href="http://echo.forensicpanel.com/2000/12/27/apneano.html">sleep
disorders and the people</a> who treat them. Tomorrow we're going
to visit a sleep center nearby and ask some questions and
observe.</p>
<p>I bought the <a

Spike Jonze DVD</a>. More on that later.</p>

			 <p>What's new?</p>
<p>A lot of changes for me lately. Tonight I'm singing up for my
new courses. I'm excited about the new Circuits course that will
be offered. I've also just started in Amateur Radio club, which
fits pretty nicely with the whole circuits interest and
everything. Other than that I think I'm going to take a class at
Wellesley, although I haven't decided on one yet.</p>
<p>I've recently been hired to do the Research Working Group
website. It's nice to actually have content and a goal for making
a webpage. Maybe somewhere in the process I'll get some ideas for
this page.</p>
<p>I'm coming home for Thanksgiving! I'm pretty excited, since
I've really wanted to see my family lately.</p>

			 <p>It’s April!</p>
<p>And there is snow outside. It doesn’t feel like the end
of the school year is near. I bet if I were in a warmer climate I
would have that great feeling I remember from Oklahoma that
summer is coming soon.</p>
<p>The results are in for the <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/">MCM</a>. Kathy
and I received an Honorable Mention for our paper. The paper had
some holes in it for sure but I think our approach was well
thought out.</p>
<p>Dean Kamen is coming to town soon. This Wendesday <a href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin</a> will be holding its <a href="http://www.olin.edu/homepage_featurestory.asp">Big
Conversations</a> day. Some students will be presenting to him
some business ideas revolving around the dynamic balancing
technology of the Segway. Just this week I found out that <a href="http://wozcam.woz.org/">Steve Wozniak</a>, cofounder of <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple Computer</a> and general cool
guy, will be coming for the next Big Conversations day in the
next fall semester. I couldn’t be more thrilled.</p>
<p>More to come...</p>

			 <p>What about last month?!</p>
<p>OK so that last update didn’t say a whole lot. I know, I
know. Well here is an update on what's been going on in Grantland
since I talked to you last.</p>
<p>I took the Mathematical Contest in Modeling with Kathy. The
MCM is a mathematical modeling competition in which you get a few
days more than a weekend to research, create a mathematical
model, and write a paper about some system. This year we did <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2003/problems/">
Problem A</a>, in which a motorcycle stuntman jumps over an
elephant for a movie and lands in cardboard boxes. Our mission
was to describe how cardboard would cushion his fall, although I
would say our paper's strength was less in answering that
question and more in considering a lot of different external
factors that other groups may not have considered. Like, for
instance, how to set up the shot so that it looks interesting in
a widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio frame.</p>
<p>A week later was St. Valentine's Day and I started it off
right by losing the ability to run Windows. I then ran off to <a href="http://www.needham.mec.edu/Hillside/">Hillside
Elementary</a> and taught some fourth-graders about electricity
and shocked them with a <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/vdg.htm">Van de Graaff
generator</a>. Sometime I might go visit the <a href="https://www.mos.org/sln/toe/">world's largest Van de
Graaff</a> at the <a href="https://www.mos.org">Boston Museum of
Science</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Van de Graaff generators, my current project for
my Project class is to build one. Que Anh, Sharon, Sutee, and I
have almost finished making a clear handheld Van de Graaff that
aims to make it more apparent to kids what is going on inside. It
looks really swanky. We ordered our <a href="http://www.waterscapesweb.com/orbs.html">sphere</a> from a
<a href="http://www.waterscapesweb.com/">backyard/pool decoration
company</a>, of all places, so ours looks the best in my
opinion.</p>
<p>Well anyway after all that mess it was time to go to the
Valentine dance. Beforehand my two dates, Clara and Janet, and I
went with Dan and Frances to a pretty good Italian restaurant, <a href="http://chefmoz.org/United_States/MA/Newton/Appetito954312216.html">
Appetito</a>, in <a href="http://www.teethwhitening-dentist.com/manewtoncenterteethwhitening.html">
Newton Center</a>. From there we returned to Olin and the dining
hall where a multiple-story cardboard Eiffel Tower had been
constructed. The dance was somewhat fun and now Clara is my
girlfriend. You might be asking, “What about poor Janet,
your other date?” Well it turns out that now she is
Dan’s girlfriend, creating the odd situation where one pair
of roommates is dating another pair of roommates. Strange.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, the next weekend I went to the <a href="http://www.econference.org">2003 Stanford Graduate School
of Business Entrepreneurship Conference</a> in Palo Alto, CA. We
made some good connections and hopefully I’ll be emailing
one of the graduate students I met that was helping to run the
show so that <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford</a> and
<a href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin</a> can have some sort of
officalized relationship. This is the strange stuff that goes on
when you attend a brand new college.</p>
<p>Fast forward another weekend, and it’s once again time
for an Olin College Candidates Weekend. This year we held two
weekends, each with about seventy-five students. I must admit I
wasn’t so involved this time around. Candidate weekends are
quite impressive. The concept is that you apply to Olin, and then
a certain number of students are invited to interview and
interact with the students, faculty, staff, and administration of
Olin. Out of those who attend, the entire class is selected with
no regard given to the test scores, essays, or anything in the
submitted applications. In other words, the admission staff wants
to meet everyone and make sure they are Olin material and also
that Olin is the right place for them. Candidate Weekend I ended
with the Franklin W. Olin Players performing “The
Foreigner”, which received a standing ovation. I wonder how
much easier it is to get a standing ovation when your audience is
filled with candidates who <em>really</em> want to get in? The
second weekend ended yesterday with ExpressO, which was an
open-mic talent show event culminating in a little
mini-dance-party involving us, the faculty, prospective students,
their parents, and the staff and adminstration. I don't know of
any other school where this might happen.</p>

<p>Yes I started this post with “Linux” and then
followed up with “I finally have windows again!”</p>
<p>For the last three weeks I have been unable to run my Windows

			 <p>Long week.</p>
<p>This week, I</p>
<ul>
<li>worked on a film crew for a live telecast to the
Undersecretary of the Army and fourteen other <acronym title="Very Important Persons">VIPs</acronym>.</li>
<li>bought approximately thirty <acronym title="compact discs">CDs</acronym> for a dollar each.</li>
<li>found out my friend <a href="http://www.normalform.com/">Jon</a> is going to the <a href="http://www.sundance.org/">Sundance Film Festival</a>.</li>
<li>renewed the registration of a <a href="http://www.normalform.com/">domain name</a>.</li>
<li>rearranged the furniture in my new room.</li>
<li>baked a pizza.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last Saturday I woke up nine hours earlier than usual and went
to the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/arng-ok.htm">
Oklahoma National Guard</a> 45th Infantry Brigade headquarters
with <a href="http://www.normalform.com/">Jon</a> to pull cable
and do other grunt work for a live broadcast (narrowcast?) to
fifteen <acronym title="Very Important Persons">VIPs</acronym>
from Washington, including the <a href="http://www.army.mil/leaders/usa/">Undersecretary of the
Army</a>. The troops were engaged in war games, teamed up with
the Little Rock and Tulsa National Guard brigades to do tank
battle against a common enemy simulated by computer. The point of
the whole deal was for a fiber-optics company to show its worth
to the higher-ups and get a hefty government contract to fiber up
the country. And I made fifty bucks off of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cdwarehouse.com/"><acronym title="compact disc">CD</acronym> Warehouse</a>, based out of
Oklahoma, is going out of business. They have to clear out all
their merchandise so the <acronym title="compact discs">CDs</acronym> were only a dollar each. Jon
Denmark, Jon Hutchins, and I cleaned out the place. Actually some
other guy helped clean out the place when he bought nearly three
hundred <a href="https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=936516993&amp;category=1585">
Latin albums</a>. Anyway, I now have thirty discs more than
before.</p>
<p>Jon is headed to the <a href="http://www.sundance.org/">Sundance Film Festival</a>! On
two days’ notice, he’s headed to sunny California to
meet with <a href="http://www.paintinglight.net/">Jesse</a> and
drive to also sunny Utah. There he will watch several independent
films and attend several parties and just in general do a lot of
schmoozing. I know it will be great and he’ll have plenty
to talk about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stargateinc.com">Stargate, Inc.</a> sells
domain names for only eight dollars a year. If you want one,
they’re so cheap it’s almost worth grabbing a couple.
Jon nabbed normalform.com again. I’m mulling over getting
one myself. The other Grant lists several <a href="http://www.splorp.com/domain/">interesting domain names
that have no owner</a>.</p>
<p>My room now has the bed and television switched, among other
things. Right in time for me to fly home this Monday! Now I can
finally finish setting up my new room and sit back to enjoy it
for an hour or so.</p>
<p><a href="http://members.cox.net/austn3">Austin</a> and I made
a pizza at Jon's house last night. I said “bake” and
he said “broil”. The jury is still out on that, but I
still think that it came out well after being baked for about
eighteen minutes. What do you want on your <a href="http://www.tombstone.com/">Tombstone</a>? We had <a href="http://www.pepitup.com/">pepperoni</a>.</p>

			 <p>Bicycles</p>
<p>That’s all you see at the Super Wal-Mart up on Danforth
in Edmond, <acronym title="Oklahoma">OK</acronym>. Just go there
and check it out. It seems like an entire quarter of the store
has bikes hanging from the ceiling. I don’t know what the
deal is. I guess Christmas was filled with sedentary gifts this
season.</p>
<p>The movie has been shot. Not like with a gun but like with a
Arriflex Camera (made in Western Germany). Everything went well,
although we stayed up until 5:00 finishing. We even ordered a
pizza at 2 in the morning from a place that offers baklava and
milkshake delivery as well.</p>
<p>We watched the entire movie <span class="italictitle">Backdraft</span> between the first and second
shots of the day, thus creating the new unit of time, the
backdraft, equal to 132 minutes. We spent 7.5 backdrafts filming.
You do the math.</p>
<p>I shot two hours of behind-the-scenes video footage and took
about three hundred photos, which I just uploaded to my computer.
Needless to say this was a well-documented venture.</p>
<p>The day after shooting, Jon, Austin, Lauren, Jesse, Farah, and
I ate at the Chuck House, the best place to get a Chicken Fried
Steak Dinner for about five dollars. Yes, five dollars. You know
it’s quality when you have to order over a telephone at
your table. For some reason, Jesse's phone was wired to the
<acronym title="public address">PA</acronym> system. Farah played
some early electronic music for me in the car and after we saw
her off, the rest of us waited about thirty minutes in a
Walgreen’s parking lot as Jesse complained to the managers
and whoever about the scratched negatives on his pictures.</p>
<p>After that I had dinner with Stephanie at Ted’s
Café Escondido, <em>the</em> best place to eat in Oklahoma
City. This ’hidden cafe” has the best Mexican food
you can find, which would blow the minds of the New England types
I’m consistently surrounded by. It also blew my insides
when mixed with a Chicken Fried Steak Dinner. Well, not really,
but that’s a lot of food for one night.</p>
<p>My grandmother came down yesterday to help us move stuff
between my old room and my new upstairs room. Now all
that’s left is to do is move my bed and put a million
things in their places.</p>

			 <p>Documentration</p>
<p>I'm filming the behind-the-scenes documentary for <a href="http://www.normalform.com">Jon</a>’s new short
entitled “Jeremy”. Today I spent from 11 am to 3 am
shooting both production stills and video of the production
process. I also helped the grips and others with various odd
jobs. It's been quite an adventurous day.</p>
<p>I woke up today at 10 am which is about five hours earlier
than I usually wake up. I then followed that with sixteen
straight hours of working on the film. Needless to say I am
somewhat tired.</p>
<p>Jon really pulled out all the stops and is shooting his latest
short with a full professional film crew. The lead actress was in
Miss Congeniality as Miss Tennessee, and has been featured in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?White,+Farah">several other
films</a>. It is a pleasure and privilege to work with her. The
lead actor met Jon through Jon’s parent's church
connections and is a stage actor who is doing splendidly in his
first on-screen performance.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be the second and final gruelling day of
filming. And to think I really only had less than twenty-four
hours notice that I would be on the crew!</p>

			 <p>Monkey ball</p>
<p>These two words have dominated the previous week. As Jon was
out of town, the gang and I have found it necessary to find new
places to hang out. Monkey Ball and Monkey Ball 2, both by <a href="http://www.sega.com">SEGA</a> and for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo</a> GameCube, have been
crowd favorites. Anyone who’s buying any GameCube games
anytime soon, get three for the price of two over at Amazon using
<a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/redirect/bounce.php?fwcodeid=25121">
this coupon</a>. Just thought you should know.</p>
<p>Well Christmas happened. If you ask <a href="http://members.cox.net/austn3">Austin</a>, and I know you
will, there were <em>two</em> christmases. “Christmas
2” was at Jesse's dad's house. And yes, they are Jewish, so
it really wasn't Christmas at all, but this is Austin we're
talking about. Anyway, Austin, Jiongyi, and I ate an
eighteen-pound turkey over there (not seventeen-pound as earlier
advertised). A@ron, Jesse’s brother, continually called
Jiongyi “TC”, since he only ever knew of TC. Anyway
eventually a ton of gravy spilled onto Jesse and, well, that
changed the course of dinner substantially. Check out the picture
from Austin’s site, <a href="http://members.cox.net/austn3/andthen.html">“and
then...”</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that we held a more traditional Christmas at my
house this year, albeit traditional doesn’t describe this
one well. My cousin Nick played guitar, my brother Jon or I would
play bass guitar, and my brother Kyle or I would play drums as
Nick, my mother, or at one point a good portion of my aunts would
sing the lyrics to Nirvana’s “In Bloom”. Yes,
really. On Christmas.</p>
<p>If you want to be all superficial about Christmas, I got
clothes and money. For once I realize that these are really what
I want.</p>
<p>My life is slowly being sucked away by Linux. I have been
optimizing my <a href="https://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>
installation a lot over the last few days. Gentoo is wonderful. I
compiled everything, starting with the compiler, so I know each
program is fully optimized for my system. Also, installation is a
breeze since I only need type <code>emerge
&lt;progname&gt;</code> in order to install anything. Once I can
find a way to update my web site in Linux, there will be a lot
more updates to this site.</p>
<p>Last night we played poker to celebrate Jon’s return
from Seattle. Everyone was there and we started out with 5 draw
and 7 stud. After a while we tired of throwing around so many
cards and instead settled on <a href="http://www.holdempoker.com/texasholdemrules.html">Texas
Hold’em</a>. I highly suggest Texas Hold’em as a more
pleasurable poker experience.</p>
<p>I’m going to make a DJ mix. I think I might burn it to a
CD. I might even give out a few copies. I don’t know.</p>

			 <p>Back home.</p>
<p>Oklahoma, that is. I’ve seen a bunch of people so far. I
haven’t seen Erin, Jim, and Heather for quite a while. We
haven’t done much yet. <a href="http://www.normalform.com" title="normalform.com">Jon Denmark</a> went to <a href="http://access.wa.gov/" title="Access Washington">Washington</a>, which has created a
power vacuum as no one knows whose house to go to anymore.
I’ve invited a bunch of people over here tomorrow.</p>
<p>My brother Jon and I traded rooms today. I now live upstairs
and have inherited a conglomerated mess of old things that have
passed down from me to Kyle to Jon and back to me. Sifting
through old things has revealed lots of things like the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~missprissy/" title="PRISSY'S PLACE">prissy</a> little journal book that my
piano teacher gave to me years ago and has been sitting in the
bottom drawer for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Also found today was the <a href="http://www.vtechkids.com/pdfs/Video_Painter.pdf" title="Video Painter Manual">VTech Video Painter</a>. This device
allows one to draw on his television. <a href="http://www.tuckermcclure.com" title="Tucker McClure">Tucker</a> and I used it to make movies
back in about fourth grade. Such classics as
“Spacekids—The Final Generation”, “Jon:
The Movie starring Jon Hutchins” and “Spacekids
II—Journey to Triethyl” captivated audiences of my
immediate family and neighbor friends for many years. We would
draw each frame and then record it onto the <acronym title="Video Cassette Recorder">VCR</acronym>, adding a
soundtrack later on a cassette tape. Well beyond our years.
Perhaps the most epic of them all was “Giraffic
Park”.</p>
<p>Every time I come back from <a href="http://www.olin.edu" title="Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering">Olin</a> Jiongyi,
<a href="http://austn3.dyndns.org:348/" title="meh, Austin's new blog">Austin</a>, and I talk about
playing poker. Maybe it will happen tomorrow. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Jon, Jesse, and crew are working on filming a short. Watch for
it. It involves mystery, death, blood, and deception. In fact you
might say it involves <a href="https://www.somethingawful.com/firemancomics/murderousdeception.htm" title="A stylish thriller that centers on a relationship crammed full of deception and murder.">
Murderous Deception</a>. Be sure not to miss it.</p>
<p>Jim wanted me to write about how we went to go see the new <a href="http://www.ci.edmond.ok.us/recreation/skate_park.html" title="City of Edmond Skate Park">skate park</a> but didn’t
skate on it and also how we went to the <a href="http://www.tacocabana.com/" title="When’s the last time you took the trip to Taco Cabana?">
Taco Cabana</a> and also how we went to go eat dinner tonight at
the <a href="http://www.delta-cafe.com/" title="Some other Delta Cafe in Finland">Delta Cafe</a> and ate
for free because Erin works there. I had my beloved <a href="http://www.chefrick.com/html/friedcorn.html" title="Chef Rick’s Fried Corn">Fried Corn on the Cob</a>.

			 <p>Oklahoma in 2 days</p>
<p>I poked around on the Internet a lot these last few days of
freshman semester I. The first oddity I came across was <a href="http://www.splorp.com">Splorp</a>. I have been thinking of
doing an independent study / passionate pursuit (as
we call them) on typography. Essentially I’ve been
considering designing my own font and getting some side credit
for it. Well after casually browsing I found this Splorp site
which is a blog of a certain Grant Hutchinson. Grant Hutchinson
who has made fonts and is interested in several things I am also
interested in. Grant Hutchinson who <a href="http://www.splorp.com/about/">brags</a> that he is number
one when you search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Grant+Hutchinson%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">
“Grant Hutchinson”</a> on Google. It so turns out
that I am the number one result for the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Grant+Hutchins%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">
“Grant Hutchins”</a> search on Google. Needless to
say he will be receiving an email in his inbox shortly relating
to this matter.</p>
<p>The scary thing is that this isn’t the first time
I’ve run into this strange <a href="http://webhome.idirect.com/~donlong/monsters/Html/Doppelga.htm">
doppelganger</a> phenomenon. A few years back when I was
considering becoming a Japanese translator, I found a Grant
Hutchins who lives in Oregon and is a Japanese translator.
Needless to say I feel less unique when I find these people.</p>
<p>Another oddity I’ve found is this shoddy <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs2002b/Welcome_Opening_Page.htm">
college report on medieval British literature</a> that stole the
image of Olin’s campus. Why did this person decide to steal
an image from our website and reassign the Academic Center as a
<a href="http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/English/Beowulf/eBeowulf/guide.htm">
Beowulf</a> museum? Since when is the Campus Center a shrine to
<a href="http://www.pathguy.com/kinglear.htm">King Lear</a>? And
the Olin Center as an archive of information on <a href="http://www.camelotthemepark.co.uk/">Arthurian Legend</a>?
Laughable at best!</p>
<p>Other than that I’ve just been sticking to pages like <a href="http://www.sharpeworld.com">Sharpeworld</a> and <a href="http://www.coudal.com">Coudal Partners</a> for wasting
time. The links here are marvelous. I’ve also been visiting
<a href="http://www.plep.org">Plep</a> a little bit, but not as
much as much of the content isn’t personally that
interesting to me. One recent favorite is the <a href="http://death.oracion.co.jp/parkanimal/index.htm">Japanese
park animals gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Back in reality I’m finishing up my finals. <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/billh333/auditron.htm">All I
have left</a> is my Differential Equations exam.</p>
<p>Somehow I busted up my laptop. Thanks to Dell’s great
service plan that I have bought into through <a href="http://www.olin.edu">my college</a>, however, I have
gotten, for free, a completely new plastic shell, touchpad, and
motherboard for my laptop. And all just because my USB port was
busted. No questions asked. I feel spoiled, but I am paying for
it I guess.</p>

			 <p><p>Where to start?</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the <a href="http://www.wbcn.com/wbcn_com_xmasrave_files/paradise.htm">WBCN
Xmas Rave</a> <a href="http://www.moby.com">Moby</a> show at the
<a href="http://boston.cc.com/paradise.asp">Paradise Rock
Club</a> in Boston, MA. He billed it as a show in which he will
be playing older songs in his journal. I was quite excited to get
to hear some of the earlier more electronic songs. I found that
this really wasn’t the case, however. The only old songs he
played that he usually wouldn’t were “That’s
When I Reach For My Revolver” and “Next is the
E”. After playing a couple songs, he came out and said,
“We have a goal for tonight. We’re going to play the
longest show we ever have,” which was met by much applause.
I was quite close to the stage. So close, in fact, that Moby
himself stepped on my hand. I was right in front of two of the
subwoofers and essentially leaning on them as Moby would jump up
on it and play his guitar in such a manner that I would have to
look directly up to see him. I was jumping up and down a lot, and
had to watch the height so I wouldn’t bump into his…
crotch. He stepped on my hand at one point and might have been
pointing to me as I was jumping. Anyway Dan and I had a lot of
fun. Dan was especially happy when Moby left and came back in a
cheaply made shirt with iron-on letters that spell “COVER
BAND”. Moby covered about ten of Dan’s favorite
classic rock songs, some in different styles. Read about it on my
new <a href="concerts.html">concerts</a> page.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the show Dan and I waited around with the hope
that Moby would come out and meet us or that something else
interesting would happen. While waiting around I noticed that
Moby’s beloved carrot juice was sitting on stage. I
wondered if they would give it to us if we asked, half-jokingly.
Dan pulled a roadie aside and said “Hey will you give us
that carrot juice? It was his birthday,” to which the man
responded, “You really want his <em>backwashed</em> carrot
juice?!” Needless to say we received said carrot juice,
which is now sitting in my room. It’s in a <a href="http://www.dasani.com">Dasani</a> bottle.</p>
<p>This morning I checked Moby’s online journal to see if
he had mentioned the idiotic jumping fan in front of him at the
show or the fact that his carrot juice was missing, and instead I
learned that after the show he had been attacked by three
“preppy” men “with mace” who punched him
in the face for no apparent reason. This comes as quite a shock,
but Moby is not mad and did not fight back. Such is his
style.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes ago I learned that the lead
singer / Moog player / trombonist for
<a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk">Stereolab</a>, Mary Hansen,
has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/12/mroom.stereolab/">
died in a freak bicycle accident</a>. I am glad that Stereolab
got to reason as much music as they did, something like an album
a year for a full decade. I am quite impressed by their wide
assortment, and have several of their limited edition vinyl
singles. Every single they release comes in limited edition
versions. I had the fortune to attend their recent show in Boston
at the <a href="http://avalon.billcrook.com/">Avalon</a>, one of
the only shows that resulted in a <em>double</em> encore. I read
a funny <a href="http://www.koly.com/stereolab/reviews/review.php?sid=85">review</a>
of this show once, calling mine the “lamest crowd”
ever for Stereolab. I thought it was quite laid back, and this
reviewer thought it was rowdy. This shows the disparity between
the shows the two of us are used to.</p>
<blockquote class="newsupdate">

			 <p>No more teenagehood.</p>
<p>My twentieth birthday was yesterday. It was one of the busier
days I’ve had in a while, but it was nice that a few people
did something for me! First at the Math Table showing of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119217">Good Will Hunting</a>,
Prof. Sarah Spence brought some cupcakes and even some salsa and
chips. Much appreciated! After that I retired to my room around
11:30 p.m. and discovered that my bed was covered with balloons.
There was a jar of silly string sitting next to my bed, and no
one to be found anywhere. I wandered down the hall and ran into
Nicole and Kathleen realizing they had missed their chance to
surprise me. They had been waiting in my room for over an hour
and went to look for me. Dan had no idea and was in the other
room.</p>
<p>I went <a href="bowling.html">bowling</a> the other day at <a href="http://www.lanesgames.com">Lanes and Games</a>. I have been
improving considerably lately. The second of two games resulted
in a tie of my personal record. With just 100 in the 8th frame, I
hit a strike on the 9th, strike on the 10th, third strike to make
perhaps my first turkey in my life, and then rounded it out with
seven more to make 157. I didn’t get the Ms. Pac-Man high
score, however.</p>
<p>My cohort project course has completed. I feel that we could
have done better on our design, but we did find a good amount of
success. Our crowning achievement is that we spent only 6.5% of
our budget. One of our goals at the outset was to set an example
for thriftiness.</p>
<p>Similarly, all my other classes are winding to a close. A week
from Thursday I’ll be flying back to Oklahoma for a full
month. Not a full-month flight, but a full-month vacation. I just
realized that I used “winding down” to describe my
classes in the last post. I’m not very creative lately
after all!</p>
<p>I was perusing the <a href="http://www.coudal.com/">Coudal
Partners</a> website the other day and wandered onto the <a href="http://www.coudal.com/tennisarc.php">Photoshop Tennis</a>
competitions. The idea is that two designers representing
different design groups send Photoshop “volleys” back
and forth (spending approx. 30 mins–2 hours per volley) and
then editing what comes back. The evolution of these graphics is
quite interesting and often unexpected. One of my favorites is
the transition from <a href="http://www.coudal.com/tennis/-temp01.php?matchid=011109_pray&amp;volley=07">
this</a> to <a href="http://www.coudal.com/tennis/-temp01.php?matchid=011109_pray&amp;volley=08">
this</a>. Anyway, I’ve challenged <a href="http://students.olin.edu/jfernandez">Jesus Fernandez</a> to
a little sparring match. Watch for this sometime soon.</p>
<p>The other day I became very interested in <a href="http://members.aol.com/eddanamta/abandoned/abanstas.html">abandoned
subway tunnels, tracks, and stations</a> in the Boston area. I
have been learning about parts of the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/traveling_t/schedules_subway.asp">MBTA
“T” subway system</a> are no longer running,
including an <a href="http://www.nycsubway.org/us/boston/orange/">elevated train
called the “El”</a> that used to run near Washington
Ave up until the 1980s. It is being replaced by the new <a href="http://www.allaboutsilverline.com/">Silver Line</a>. Anyway
it makes me want to go visit an abandoned train station, although
that would probably be a very bad idea.</p>

			 <p>Today I’m feeling creative. Maybe it’s the great
amount of light outside reflecting off of the snow. Maybe
it’s the fact that my classes are winding down. Maybe
not.</p>
<p>Today my Moby tickets arrived! <a href="http://www.moby.com/">Moby</a> is holding a concert this
Wednesday at the <a href="http://www.nextticketing.com/paradise.html">Paradise Rock
Club</a> in Boston. This is where I saw <a href="http://www.fountainsofwayne.com">Fountains of Wayne</a> a
couple weekends back. This should prove to be a good show,
because Moby <a href="http://www.moby.com/cms/viewdiary.asp?Diary_ID=1097&amp;ViewType=Current">
mentioned in his online journal</a> that he is going to play his
older more electronic songs. He’ll also have been off tour
for a week at home in New York City, so he should be even more
energetic than ever. Moby is also not only the headliner, but the
<em>only</em> act playing. This means he will get all sorts of
time to try new things and wow the crowd. Plus, the Paradise is
such a cozy venue, where it’s literally impossible to stand
more than about 30 feet from the stage. The show was sold out
right after I decided to go, so I perused <a href="https://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> for <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&amp;krd=1&amp;from=R8&amp;MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;SortProperty=MetaEndSort&amp;query=Moby+Boston">
people reselling tickets</a>. However, I found them pricey, so I
emailed a guy <a href="https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1941209579">
whose auction didn’t sell</a> and made him an offer and now
have two tickets in my possession.</p>
<p>I went to Oklahoma for Thanksgiving. The first night ended in
a controversy that lead <a href="http://www.normalform.com">Jon</a>, Austin, and I to leave
Rima’s birthday party. That’s all I will say for now.
Later that week, I bought a <a href="http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?A_PROD_NO=EM1">Korg
Electribe EM-1 Music Production Station</a>, a type of half-drum
machine half-synthesizer little sound unit, at <a href="http://www.marsmusic.com">Mars Music</a>, which is going
out of business and having a huge sale. I literally watched it
get marked down from 30% to 40% off. That’s like 40 bucks
less. My brothers and I are going to form a band and try to
record some music over Christmas break. Jon plays bass and
(increasingly) guitar, while Kyle plays drums.</p>
<p>I’ve been sleeping a lot lately. My naps are dominating
my days now. I’ve got to learn to stay awake.</p>
<p>My mom enters a lot of contests (or “sweeps”, if
you’re so inclined). She wins about four or five contests a
month now! The most significant prize won is an MP3 player. Now
she’s got me hooked on <a href="http://pantsofchance.leedungarees.com">Lee Dungarees Pants
of Chance</a>. This is the best slot machine ever. Free credits,
and you might win oysters or tube socks. What could be
better?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.feartheclown.com">Fear the Clown</a> named
one of my songs Song of the Day a couple weeks ago. Three of my
friends used to be in a band named (at times) Pivot and (at other
times) <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/old/shamespiral/">Shamespiral</a>.
I wrote a little ambient song entitled (creatively)
“Shamespiral Intro” that was used to introduce their
final two shows. I’ll throw it up on my <a href="music/index.html">Grant Music</a> page in a bit.</p>
<p>I’ve added some pictures to my <a href="pictures/index.html">Grant Pictures</a> page.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m about to go to bed so I can take the <a href="http://math.scu.edu/putnam/">Putnam Exam</a> tomorrow. The
snow everywhere reflects the moonlight and makes it feel like
day. This will be an adventure. I prefer to sleep in total
sensory deprivation myself.</p>

<p>I’m sitting at my desk sipping an Orange Slice. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=humannews&amp;StoryID=1715112">
Newton’s <em>Principia</em> was stolen</a> the other day. I
guess they let anyone request it and put their grimy paws on it.
Someone’s grimy paws were sticky this time.</p>
<p>I’ve had the busiest weekend imaginable! It all started
Friday (as weekends usually do) when I left with Nicole, Jesus,
and (note the change in roster) Kori Haymore, one of the new
students. We went to the <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/">
Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary</a> of the <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/">Massachusetts Audubon
Society</a>. It was very nice. We stayed in the Innermost Cabin,
which was barely enough to fit four people and a Franklin stove.
We walked around a bit and then sat by the fire and kerosene
lamps reading the journal entries from previous guests. Of
particular interest were the horror stories by various
eleven-year-old children. My favorite was “Werewolf
Man” although “Pigmonkeyman” was also a
favorite. I’ll post fulltext up here soon.</p>
<p>The next morning I got back from Ipswich with less than 15
minutes to go before once again leaving to go to the only proper
bowling alley in all Boston. It turns out that New England has
its own special type of bowling called Candlepin Bowling that
seems inferior. The balls are smaller and the pins are simple
cylinders. Hardly engaging! Anyway I got my best three game
series in my life. I’m launching a <a href="bowling.html">new section of my page</a> devoted to bowling
scores. This may sound odd, but I’ve wanted to do this for
about five years now. I got 137, 128 and 149. 149 was the best
game of the night and my second best score ever, although the
best average score goes to Emma Goodman, an IMSA girl from the
great bowling state of Illinois. The last game was quite eventful
in that I hit the first 50 pins down without a slip. Four spares
and one strike.</p>
<p>Later that night back at Olin we held a Dead or Alive 3
tournament in the Dining Hall on the big projected screen. The
scene was quite impressive, quite larger than life. I’m not
a big fan of 3D fighting games or the X-Box in general so I
merely spectated. Afterwards I felt nostalgic so I downloaded
MAME in order to play Galaga. Well worth my trouble.</p>
<p>The next morning I woke up to attend a five-hour session on
the traditional Japanese board game Go. I am starting to enjoy it
more and perhaps I will get better at it. It is perhaps the most
complicated game I know and there’s no chance for me (or
any human or even a computer) to ever master the game. The best
Go-playing computers can’t beat twelve-year-olds. Go was
heavily featured in the movie <a href="http://www.pithemovie.com">Pi: Faith in Chaos</a> which is
coincidentally my favorite movie.</p>
<p>Right after that I took my take-home physics final in what
would turn out to be the only three-hour patch of free time for
the weekend. Keep in mind it’s already Sunday by this
point. I had to hurry up and finish the exam (which I felt I did
quite well on, even though there were many little details to
consider).</p>
<p>I really wanted to go to the local <a href="http://www.marsmusic.com">Mars Music</a> store because they
are going out of business nationwide. Everything must go! Prices
marked down 20-40%! That means a lot for musical equipment! That
can make or break so many potential sales! My mom and I were
talking about buying an electric guitar so that we can complete
the newest boy band craze at home, Hutchins. Hutchins is like
Hanson except instead of being from Tulsa, OK, we are from
Edmond, OK. No difference. Except shorter hair. Anyway it turns
out that both locations near me were in the list of four stores
nationwide that have already closed, so I didn’t get to go
run around crazily and pick out items like candy. Oh, bother.</p>
<p>The weekend ended on a wonderful note when I went with <a href="http://web.mit.edu/sheeva/www/">Sheeva</a> to the <a href="http://www.fountainsofwayne.com">Fountains of Wayne</a>
concert. It was at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston on Comm Ave.
This venue is great! I highly recommend it! The place is so small
and cozy and right when I walked into the auditorium I found
myself right in the center only 6 or 7 people back. I stayed
there and danced with Sheeva the whole time, often to an extent
much greater than that of the considerably older populace about
us. While there I bumped into Que Anh and Erin McCusker, both of
whom had accompanied Alex Valdivia. This means that 7.5% of our
school was there. I got there an hour after doors opened and I
completely missed the first act, OKGo. I should have known Que
Anh would come since she is obsessed with them. The show ended
relatively early but started relatively early as well. I knew
every song except for the ones that are on the new album. The
verdict on the new material? Fountains of Wayne are coming back
for more in their third release due out this spring, moving in a
more experimental direction while continuing to capture the
familiar catchiness and heart of their earlier work. By the way,
nothing beats the final piano of “Leave the Biker”.
It sent shivers down my spine. After the second (!) encore I
grabbed a nice brown shirt that says simply “FoW” and
got back home with a good amount of time to goof around and then
get a good night of sleep.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I am also sick and this last weekend was met
with much coughing. I’ve vowed to slow down my plans this
week and let this finally subside.</p>

			 <p>Pretty much everything is done!</p>
<p>Not really, but I don’t have much to do anymore. I got
my <acronym title="Engineering Computing">EC</acronym> lab <a href="pid_lab.pdf">written up</a>.</p>
<p>In other news, our Project class is wrapping up with the ASME
ramp project and moving on to new projects because we feel that
we should be covering more material than we are. I am currently
brainstorming some project ideas, including one that might
involve developing a product with Jay Gantz to possibly try to
get to market. Depends on how ambitious I’m feeling. We
have a good idea that might be profitable, or might not even be
possible. We’re through with calculus in my Mathematical
Foundations in Engineering I course, so now we’re starting
Differential Equations. I am quite happy for that, as I
haven’t really had any new math for three years now.</p>
<p>Dan Frey, the Professor for our Project class, recently
decided to leave Olin and go to MIT to head a high-profile design
class that involves robots and some sort of competitive edge. It
often makes it onto television shows like Scientific American
Frontiers. The MIT course has previously been run by Woodie
Flowers, who used to host Scientific American Frontiers and is
currently shared by both Olin and MIT. We’ll all miss Dan
but it sounds like a wonderful opportunity that he definitely
deserves.</p>
<p>Sheeva and I are going to the <a href="http://www.fountainsofwayne.com">Fountains of Wayne</a>
concert on Sunday! Fountains of Wayne are great. Every song
I’ve ever heard from them sticks in my head and I know all
the lyrics even though I don’t try.</p>
<p>Also, today Nicole invited me to go with Jesus and Kathleen to
a cabin in Ipswich for Friday night. I think it should be fun.
I’ve never been to Ipswich and frankly I’m not sure
where it is. It’s an hour away.</p>
<blockquote class="newsupdate">
<div class="updatedate">November 11, 2002</div>
<div class="updatetext">But Kathleen was busy so Kori ended up
coming instead. Why is this important? I have this strange
obsession with who is with me and where they are situated in
relation to me. I often have dreams where I can only remember
sitting with a group of people at a table. I remember where each
person sat and somehow it seems quite important to me. Just one
of those things.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, I am quite busy this weekend and I’ll
get a Physics test tomorrow that’s due Monday. I hopefully
will get it done tomorrow night. Then there’s the Calculus
test I get tomorrow as well, but isn’t due until Wednesday.
It all compounds.</p>

			 <p>Will everything ever be done?</p>
<p>I have shown up approximately 2 minutes late to each and every
class this week, which is quite embarrassing. I also haven't been
getting much sleep. Oh well. I'm getting all my work done, even
if it means spending four evenings out of my week trying to get
<a href="pid_lab.png">data</a> for <a href="http://ec.ece.olin.edu/labs/Project1.pdf">my silly
lab</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://students.olin.edu/nhori">Nicole</a> and I are
currently trying to measure the temperature of a hot plate and a
cup of water being heated by the hot plate. We wrote a program in
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a>
that measures the temperature and then controls the hot plate so
that the water ends up at <a href="http://www.billzilla.org/f1story.htm">exactly 50 degrees
Celsius</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, I'm leaving for the Big Apple late tomorrow
night. I'm excited because Tucker and I are going to a really
nice Mexican restaurant. Dan, Tucker, and I went to Taco Bell
after the Area 2 show and it was like manna sent from heaven.
Other than that we don't get much Mexican food up here. When I
say that, however, I am <a href="http://eric.diaryland.com/daytrip2.html">lying through my
teeth</a>. Our dining hall makes some really good tacos and <a href="http://swankivy.envy.nu/silvfern.html">nachos and
whatnot</a>, as per our request. We have the freaking best dining
hall on the planet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,823659,00.html">
Jam Master Jay was killed today</a>. He was influential in early
80s hip-hop and as the DJ for <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists/R/Run_DMC/?il=1">
Run-DMC</a> helped pioneer much of what music is like today. He
was not a gangster/thug/idiot. He leaves behind a wife and three
children. It comes as a shock to see him go, as there seems to be
no reason for anyone to have a grudge against him. He was shot
while in the recording studio. News stories compare it to <a href="http://www.usd.edu/trio/sum97/rappers.html">Tupac and
Notorious B.I.G.</a> but there really is no comparison, as those
two had <a href="http://www.compearth.com/stuntaz/">lifestyles</a> that put
their lives at risk anyway.</p>

For instance, "<a href="http://web2.incl.ne.jp/yaoki/a2002.htm">1+23+456*7*89</a>"

			 <p>Another day, another dollar.</p>
<p>I'm eating Trader Joe's Shredded Bite Size Wheats while
waiting my turn for the shower. I'm about to go to Project class
with Dan Frey where I'm going to work with my team on our design
for the <a href="http://www.asme.org/students/Competitions/designcontest/2003/Y2003index.html">
ASME Design Competition</a>. The contest is to see how much rice
we can move up a ramp by using only the energy from 2 liters of
water that drain out of a <a href="http://www.janitationdepot.com/shop/search/hierarchyResults.asp?type=3&amp;DIV%5FID=38&amp;CATG%5FID=3808&amp;SUB%5FCATG%5FID=3808002&amp;ANDOR=&amp;WILDCARDS=&amp;STEMMING=&amp;advancedqu=bucket&amp;SID=NWPDP8FK9QTT8LXS9MWL1HGC0FF2A4P7&amp;PP=0">
bucket</a> about a meter or so off the ground.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll get into more detail later, as <a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a> (Lindquist
this time) is now getting out of the shower.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.normalform.com">Jon Denmark</a>
was talking to me about how he had just learned that his
grandparents read his webpage. Not more than two hours later my
dad called to check up on me and offhand mentioned that my
grandparents read my webpage. On the same day.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm thinking about going to the <a href="http://www.fountainsofwayne.com">Fountains of Wayne</a>
show a week from this Sunday. Their music has been in my head for
the last two 24-hour cycles. I sent out an email to Sheeva and
Brian so I could catch up with my webpage's two greatest (only?)
fans. I'm gonna see Sheeva in a couple weeks which is good since
it's been <em>forever</em>. I just got an email from good ol'
Brian Morrow. I've been catching up with him and he's doing good.
He's inspiring me to start an Olin academic team. I think we need
one, and I'm ready to start it and be captain if need be.</p>
<p>Other than that I'm reading Richard Wright's <i>Black Boy</i>
for my Bodies in Motion class. <em>Aiee!</em> I have to read 384
pages. Oh well at least I enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>There's a lot going on, but also not much.</p>
<p>I'm going to <acronym title="New York City">NYC</acronym> next
weekend with Kathleen (Dupaya). I'm going to meet up with my good
friend <a href="http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com">Tucker</a>, who
goes to <a href="http://www.columbia.edu">Columbia
University</a>. I'm very excited because on Saturday night I will
be seeing the <a href="http://www.astralwerks.com/chemical/">Chemical
Brothers</a>! The Chemmies are the number one ultimate best most
wanted band for me to go see in concert ever, so hopefully this
will be good. I've already missed the opportunity to see their
shows four times. While I was in Paris, they played two shows in
London. While I was in London, they played a show in Paris. They
had their first <acronym title="United States">US</acronym> tour
in three years, but only came as close as New York. I planned a
trip to go down to see them, but then couldn't find a ticket
after they sold out. Now, finally, they are playing another final
show in New York. (The only show only according to their
itinerary) This means that this show is some sort of special
occasion, so I won't be seeing them in the tour mode where
they're playing shows each night. Hmm, sounds like a good
opportunity to debut some new material, eh?</p>

<p>I just got back from the Knight Party at Pepsico Gymnasium. I
don't know why it's a Knight party when it's not at Knight
Auditorium, but it is. That's <a href="http://www.babson.edu">Babson</a> for ya. Anyway I had fun
until they played Rednex's "Cottoneye Joe". Whoever wrote that
song should be shot! I refuse to dance to it.</p>

<div class="updatetext">My mom reminded me that "Cotton-eyed Joe"
is an old song that's been around for centuries and has been

person who does makes a much better song than, shudder,

</blockquote>
<p>I'm DJing a party at Olin this weekend (right before I leave
for New York). I think I'll play some <a href="http://www.u96.de/">U96</a> and a track or two from Fatboy
Slim's <a href="http://www.astralwerks.com/fbs/boutique.html">"On
the Floor at the Boutique"</a> mix album. It's always good to

			 <p>Everything's on the up and up.</p>
<p>Right now I'm in between classes. This morning I had my Arts
and Humanities course, "Bodies in Motion", which is all about
immigration and stuff like that. It's really great to learn about
early 1900s life. I also like having a class with <a href="http://www.babson.edu">Babson</a> students (and a Babson
professor) in it.</p>
<p>Later this afternoon I have <a href="http://ec.ece.olin.edu">Engineering Computing</a>, which is
a course all about using computers to receive inputs and control
things. Our homework last night was to write programs that record
sound and then play it back. We also made some that are triggered
by clapping. This should be one of my favorite courses this year.
We're going to do other things like control hot plates based on
the temperature and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Yesterday my team of four started building a structure for our
<a href="http://www.asme.org/students/Competitions/designcontest/2003/Y2003index.html">
<acronym title="American Society of Mechanical Engineers">ASME</acronym>
Design Contest</a> courses. In other words, we are all operating
dangerous machinery. I'm now trained on the circular saw, jigsaw,
drill, and router. I must say I enjoy it, although I can really
tell that I'm going to be an <acronym title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</acronym>
major.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I went into Boston proper, or actually
Cambridge I guess. While in the land of the Cantabrigian we
frequented the Tower Records in Harvard Square. They have a
section of singles (almost half of which are imports) that are
priced quite surprisingly low, so I picked up about 5 or 6 CDs
each under 3 dollars. That's less than the price of an album
nowadays it seems. I also bought an Atari Teenage Riot vinyl EP
and a couple of DVDs, namely Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy and
the Prodigy's new video "Baby's Got a Temper".</p>
<p>And all day long I listen to <a href="http://mp3.voila.fr">Radio FG</a>.</p>
<p>For now, it's lunch time!</p>

			 <p>Anyway, hopefully I'll post a new message up here when I have
something more positive to report. I have done many great and fun
things lately. Also I hope to have a pictures section soon.</p>
<p>Things are hectic.</p>
<p>I haven't had a break in ten days. Yes, ten days. I think it
will be better by this weekend, but I literally have only had
about 24 hours of free time so far, and they have been spent
climbing a mountain.</p>
<p>Not that I'm trying to sound too negative here. I'm just
involved in a lot of things right now. It should taper off pretty
soon. But it's just that I'm not completely unpacked yet and I've
lived here for ten days.</p>
<p>I'm going to speak with my professors about my workload,
although I do think it's getting more reasonable.</p>

<p>I've actually updated my site! Unfortunately this is one of
those crappy updates where I cop out and say I'm really busy and
can't update nearly as often. Maybe I will move away from the
news model and go more towards random pages of random content. I
think that would be more fulfilling. If I'm really ambitious I'll
do a weekly update.</p>
<p>But don't count on it, I have physics homework.</p>

			 <p>Two more days.</p>
<p>For lunch I had <a href="http://members.aol.com/AnneDroidz/mcdsux.html">McDonald's</a>.
It was fun. I hadn't been in awhile. I ordered the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~melissaness/AJ.HTM">Double
Cheeseburger Meal</a>, confusing it for the Two Cheeseburger
Meal. I guess I'm just that unobservant, at least at <a href="http://www.jacksonlocal.com/mcdonalds/regmenu.html">McDonald's</a>.
I've been using ketchup on my fries again lately. I went many
years with <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/md/tristessa/thought.html">no
ketchup</a>. It was somewhat nice to taste the potatoes more. Now
ketchup is exciting again, however. I enjoy it. I guess that's
the secret to enjoying life. Artificially prevent yourself from
doing something, then do it after a long enough delay. It makes
life more interesting.</p>
<p>Today I was all over the place. From the (old) <acronym title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</acronym> Lab to
the (fake) <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>
room on the (real) campus, I ran around with the <a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/bill/linus/linus-posse.png">
Linux Posse</a>. The Linux Posse is Gill, Brian, Ben, and I. We
stormed on into <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> and told them how to
partition the machines. We were quite the <a href="http://www.videovigilante.com">vigilantes</a>, I must say.
I also met Aaron, the new Linux/Unix admin. Well anyway we had
trouble figuring out how to do it, so I gave up and left.</p>
<p>While I was up there, I helped Adam and Rod move Jesus and
Adam's big table to its final resting place. The table is filled
with memorabilia from last year. Jesus joking said he could make
anything (including a <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~ecf/coffee.html">coffeetable</a>)
for his art project last year. Well, it <a href="http://www.jokeaday.com/7aolexe.shtml">morphed quickly from
a joke to actuality</a>, and it's a beauty. <a href="http://projects.olin.edu/marsport">The History and Mystery
of Mars</a> - Episode 4 is on there, as is the tiny vase Adina
gave me before she had to return to <a href="http://www.oradea.ro/">Transylvania</a>.</p>
<p>I saw the first new students arriving today, Ben Bloom and
Mikell Taylor. There will be a large flood of people coming in
tomorrow. Joy! Both the emotion, and the Olin <a href="http://students.olin.edu">student</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going camping! The Olin <a href="http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~comp/">Outing Club</a> is going
to stay the night up on the <a href="http://thesaltysailor.com/april.htm">border between New
Hampshire and Maine</a>. Afterwards will be a hike up some
mountain, which I may or may not do, considering my strange
shallow breath syndrome.</p>
<p>Cough, cough.</p>
<p>I packed a ton of stuff today. Tomorrow I'll finish up the
little things, and the next day I'm out of temporary housing once
and for all!</p>

			 <p>Tired. So very tired.</p>
<p>Today was quite a long day. It all started simply enough, with
yet another day of toying around with <acronym title="operational amplifiers">op-amps</acronym> and such. Then
Sara barged in and abducted me from Ben.</p>
<p>We went to get the <a href="http://unicorn.olin.edu/wiki/wiki/moin.cgi/OlinHonorCode">Olin
Honor Code</a> back from the framing company. The framing company
on the way to <a href="http://www.lifescience.co.jp/framingham/framingham.htm">Framingham</a>,
that is. We got there and had to <a href="http://www.merkury.com/color.html">pick out a blue</a> for
the matte. The workers very visibly wanted to slack off, so we
ran off to <a href="http://www.wendys.com">Wendy's</a> and both
had Spicy Chicken Sandwiches.</p>
<p>As we were leaving, there was a guy who drove by with the
letters <acronym title="Whip Out Wednesdays">WOW</acronym> who
held up a card that said "<acronym title="Whip Out Wednesday">WOW</acronym>" to Sara. It stands for
"Whip Out Wednesdays". It's from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40683-2002Aug20.html">
Opie and Anthony</a> radio show, which seems to be drivel.
Essentially when a girl sees this on a <a href="http://www.wcg.org/lit/jesus/threedays.htm">Wednesday</a>,
she's supposed to flash the guy back. Yeah, that'll be
<em>really</em> successful.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=40852">Wendy's</a>,
we picked up the Honor Code, along with the wrong frame for the
[secret Orientation 2002 activity deleted]. I got to deliver the
Honor Code to the new campus and see the Campus Center again.</p>
<p>Bret, Alex, and Julie are now here. Along with Susan, they've
moved to the real residence hall. They are this year's <acronym title="Residence R-somethings (I forget)">R2's</acronym>. I never
thought I'd see the day when <a href="http://students.olin.edu/">Olin students</a> would live in
real buildings.</p>
<p>After work, I was instantly pulled along to go eat at the <a href="http://www.closetelvis.com/Editorials/Marcelo/cheesecake.htm">
Cheesecake Factory</a>. Only, it didn't work out. The wait for
our unannounced group of fourteen would have been a couple hours,
so we instead went to <a href="http://www.abruzzoitalico.it/intro/deaqua/en/elisir.asp?ID=17&amp;sez=elisir">
Papa Razzi</a> across the street. Yes, two words. Anyway I highly
suggest it. The food was great and they worked very hard to seat
us within about 20 minutes. Plus I got to have garlic!</p>
<p>Mmm, garlic. It's <a href="http://www.garlicvalleyfarms.com/nutrition.html">healthy</a>
for you, you know.</p>
<p>After that I packed a lot of stuff. It's going to take a lot
of boxes, as my room is filled with tons of crap. The hardest
part is pretty much out of the way, though.</p>
<p>Have you heard the song from the new artist Mario? Yes, "<a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456031/20020711/mario.jhtml">
Just a Friend 2002</a>". Well I don't like it! They took <a href="http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/audio/detail.asp?ID=1218">a
wonderful Biz Markie song</a> and did a cover. Well, it's not so
much of a cover as taking the chorus from a humorous sarcastic
song and making it into a sappy R&amp;B tune. I must say I am
appalled. The original is one of those few videos I remember
watching and loving from MTV back around 1989 when I first
discovered music videos. It's right up there with <a href="http://members.aol.com/MissOOhna/deeelite.html">Deee-Lite</a>'s
"<a href="http://www.geocities.com/groovekittie99/">Groove is in
the Heart</a>" (which I have on vinyl, no less). <a href="http://www.towatei.com"><acronym title="Disc Jockey">DJ</acronym> Towa Tei</a> is the coolest! The
lead singer, <a href="http://www.ladykier.com">Lady Miss
Kier</a>, is now a <acronym title="Disc Jockey">DJ</acronym> as
well. So that, along with <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/supadjdmitry-screams.html">
Supa <acronym title="Disc Jockey">DJ</acronym> Dmitry</a>, makes
every member of the band an active <acronym title="Disc Jockey">DJ</acronym> right now.</p>
<p>Astronomical!</p>

			 <p><h3 class="newsdate">Tuesday, August 20, 2002</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just gotta let the nerd out of yourself.</p>
<p>I generally try to adopt a nerd-free attitude on life, but
today was an unusual situtation. I started by wearing my <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> necklace that Gary
made for me back in <a href="http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/PA_env-Her/history_1681_1945/molliemaguires.htm">
Mr. Gowen</a>&rsquo;s class.</p>
<p>Later in the day, while I was marking up the C tutorial into
<a href="https://validator.w3.org">validating</a> <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, just as a nerd
might do, <a href="http://students.olin.edu/smunson/">Sean</a>
pulled me aside with a few people to take a picture for the new
Olin Library website. Like the nerd I am, I picked up <a href="https://www.2600.com">2600</a> and started reading it for
the picture.</p>
<p>The plot really thickened when yesterday&rsquo;s plan worked out.
Olin made <a href="https://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/20/173240&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=146">
Slashdot</a>!!! It really killed our <a href="http://www.olin.edu">website</a>. Traffic halted to a
stand-still. I was pretty happy with the hundreds of comments
that came pouring in after the article got posted. Sean and I
frantically worked to dispel rumors and generally share our
experiences with the <a href="https://slashdot.org">Slashdot
community</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins">Grant
Page Central</a> was the recipient of <a href="https://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=38359&amp;cid=4107494">direct
attacks</a>! I must say I find it highly entertaining. Maybe I
shouldn&rsquo;t have <a href="http://www.iphc.org/docs/solemn/pride.html">glorified this
flame with a response</a>, but I had a lot to say. Hopefully I
was <a href="http://www.camsp.com/keypoint/survey_resources/survey_library/product_service/isp_quality/webform.htm">
fairly professional</a> about it.</p>
<p>Also, some <a href="http://web.mit.edu"><acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</acronym></a>
students want to throw a party with us now that they discovered
us on Slashdot. I know it&rsquo;s scary to imagine making social
connections with <acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</acronym>
through Slashdot, but I still think it has a good chance of
working out! (<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/hackers/25.html">NERD
ALERT!</a>)</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://students.olin.edu/sschwalbenberg">Sara</a> and I ate
at <a href="http://www.pacinis.com/Needham.htm">Pacini&rsquo;s</a>
today. We both had the lasagna. Very cool.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com">Tucker</a> for the
last time today. He&rsquo;s off to New York and <a href="http://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> on Sunday;
until then he&rsquo;s back in Oklahoma City. How ironic, he&rsquo;s in
<acronym title="Oklahoma City, OK">OKC</acronym> and I&rsquo;m in
Boston. We talked about <a href="http://www.deoxy.org/deoxy.htm">Einstein&rsquo;s Theories of
Relativity</a> for a while and he took off. We&rsquo;ve been getting in
long discussions lately. It&rsquo;s healthy. You should try it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to really think television is dumb. From <a href="http://www.clueless.com/jargon3.0.0/flame_war.html">defending
my blog today</a> to engaging in long conversations, I must say
the human factor is much more important than watching the <a href="http://www.realamherst.com/tube.htm">boob tube</a>. I know
I watch it a lot, but I at least try to do more productive
things. If you ask someone what the best thing they did <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~porcello/mv/tv/tv.html">while
watching TV</a> was, I bet it&rsquo;s a ton worse than the best thing
they&rsquo;ve done without TV.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve starting ripping down my posters and packing some stuff
up. With only three packing days left, <a href="http://www.zend.com/zend/cs/trialsport.php">time is of the
essence</a> for sure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/oh/athena2/cindy.html">Sheesh! I&rsquo;m
pooped! I&rsquo;m going to bed!</a></p></p>

			 <p>Welcome to the <a href="http://www.uriah.com/apple-qt/1984.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that we live in the <a href="http://www.bttf.com/">future</a>? I know we
<em>literally</em> don't, but at least we are starting to live in
what I call the "<a href="http://www.fissionpile.com/tech.html">classical
future</a>". For instance, we now have cloning. We talk about <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mars/mars_crew.html">sending
people to Mars</a> as an afterthought. I can play poker against
<a href="http://www.depardieu.8m.com/">Gerard Depardieu</a>
online and not even know it. The <a href="http://www.sue-it.com/">Segway Human Transporter</a> runs
off your subtle subconscious movements.</p>
<p>What if going to Mars was an economic question rather than a
technical one?</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> clues me in
on several technological innovations and generally cool things.
<a href="http://students.olin.edu/smunson/">Sean</a> and I are
plotting to get Olin on Slashdot. That would be good, even if it
would <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/slashdot-effect.html">
kill our servers</a>. The hype alone would generate new
applicants almost certainly. <a href="http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-kee1.htm">Keep your eyes
peeled.</a></p>
<p>I babysat for four hours today. Mark Somerville's two
daughters and I ran around <a href="http://www.needhamonline.com/background/history.html">Needham</a>
Center in the park there. We would have played with the children
statues running in a circle, but they had <a href="http://friendship-church.org/ShakopeeCampus/pages/0528%20pour%20concrete_jpg.htm">
new concrete poured</a> underneath them. After that we watched
the <a href="http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=577">Blue's
Clues <acronym title="variants include Digital Video Disc and Digital Versatile Disc, no standard name">
DVD</acronym></a>, guest starring, of all people, <a href="http://www.arachnoid.com/lutusp/humor.html">Ray
Charles</a>. Luckily they don't have a TV to watch at home (which

<p>That last sentence was rife with dependent clauses.</p>
<p>Other than that, today <a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist/">Dan</a> packed up
most of his things. The room is now very bare. The move is upon
us! We're all so ready. Just five days to go, which reminds me, I
need to make sure the sign is getting updated in the <acronym title="Modular Academic Center">MAC</acronym> that shows how many
days are left. As the <acronym title="Modular Academic Center">MAC</acronym> is actually called
the Modular Academic Center, I've heard the use of <a href="https://www.rac.co.uk/"><acronym title="Real Academic Center">RAC</acronym></a> for Real Academic
Center pick up. I don't really like this new name, but perhaps it
will stick. It wouldn't make sense too many years from now, in
the <em>real</em> future.</p>
<p>Some <acronym title="World Trade Center">WTC</acronym>
survivors/families are adding insult to incredible injury by
suing the terrorist funders for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/15/attacks.suit/index.html">trillions
of dollars</a>. To demonstrate the size of their suggested amount
(US$116 trillion), the Gross <em>World</em> Product is around
$US46 trillion. That means all economic output of all countries
would have to go toward paying these people for three years.
That's the equivalent of a Bill Gates per each person killed in
the September 11, 2001 attacks. It's also 20 of <a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/">our national debts</a>.

			 <p>Yet another day in <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/fl2/fitznorway/urine.html">Needham</a>.</p>
<p>There has been a preponderance of food here at Olin. We
feasted today yet again, trying to get rid of all this excess
food. My parents pointed out I talk about food a lot on here.
Yes, my parents do read this on a regular basis. <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=blog">Blogging</a> is
a great way to both record what you've done and communicate it to
friends and family.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a nice <a href="http://dhp.com/~alex/lamps/lamps.html">lampshade</a>. Last
year I had an extra lightbulb lying around so I bought the most
minimalist lamp I could find for it. It is literally a metal pole
with a lightbulb on top, nothing more. I even left it out without
a lampshade to be really minimalist. Now my goal is to find (or
create?) a clear yet polarized (think sunglasses) lampshade that
only lets light come through at certain angles. <a href="http://pages.tias.com/3073/PictPage/681661.html">Unfortunately</a>,
a <a href="http://www.boogle.com">Google</a> search for "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=minimalist+clear+polarized+lampshade">
minimalist clear polarized lampshade</a>" returns zero results. I
guess I just really want to be <a href="http://www.s-t.com/daily/03-00/03-19-00/f04ho209.htm">passé</a>.
I saw this great lampshade in <a href="https://www.wired.com/wiredmag/">Wired magazine</a> for 26
dollars, which I found reasonable, but the <a href="http://www.puredesignonline.com/">website</a> says you <a href="http://www.puredesignonline.com/collection/crate/product.asp?str=0&amp;id=2205">
have to order in sets of two</a>. That's pretty dumb. They lost
my sale.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com">Tucker</a> came
over and played <a href="http://pub103.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm35.showMessage?topicID=68.topic">
Warcraft III</a> with the <a href="http://students.olin.edu">Olinites</a>. He writes a lot of
webpages for <a href="http://www.quik.com/boston/">Quik
Internet</a>. We both use the same HTML editor, <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML-Kit</a>. That
surprised us both. He's leaving for <a href="http://www.newsok.com">Oklahoma City</a> on Wednesday, then
getting back Saturday night and going straight to <a href="http://www.columbia.edu">NYC</a> on Saturday to move in. I
hope to visit him soon.</p>
<p>I've busted my <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/visorprism/">Handspring
Visor Prism</a>. Luckily my dad got these "bonus points" from <a href="http://www.aventis.com/">his employer</a> (or should I say,
they gave him points in lieu of <a href="https://www.usmint.gov">actual money</a>) that can go
towards a new <a href="http://www.palm.com/products/palmm515/">Palm m515</a>. I
hope it's good; it looks like it is. Sometimes I can't help
feeling like the spoiled kid getting a new toy when his old one
broke. There was a guy at <a href="http://www.edmond.k12.ok.us/santafe/">my high school</a>
who totalled his Corvette convertible (or whatever) and so his
parents bought him a <a href="http://www.hummer.com">Hummer</a>
the next day. Oh well, at least in my case I use the thing
constantly. Anyone here can vouch for that. I use my <acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym> on a
<em>very</em> daily basis, mostly for actual useful things. Plus,
it's hard to say no when there's no actual money involved. These
silly points won't spend themselves, and <a href="http://www.worldcom.com">hardly hold their value</a>.</p>
<p>Companies losing my sale, points that don't hold their
value... Today's update has been very economically depressing.
Hope there is an upturn soon. Doesn't look like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22I+anticipate+a+healthy+market+soon%22">
anyone else does</a>.</p>

			 <p>Today was spent in Hudson, <acronym title="New Hampshire">NH</acronym>.</p>
<p>Susan invited us all to her house for a <a href="http://www.poolpartymurdermystery.com">pool party</a>. It
was grand. We had lots of food and <a href="http://www.indiepages.com/horseplay/">horsed around</a> in
the water for many hours on end. Afterwards we went to the <a href="http://www.hudsonpd.com/trading.html">Old Homes Days</a>
carnival thing. Other than the power going out, there wasn't too
much going on, so we went back to Susan's house and vented some
<a href="https://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/stories/day2_intro.htm">
frustration over construction issues</a> and the process of
moving in next week.</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>I've been getting a lot more exercise recently. Last thursday
I played Olin <a href="http://www.expat.or.id/orgs/basketball.html">Pick Up
Basketball</a> (O'Pub). I wore my Japanese headband so I could
look cool like <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/">Ryu</a>. I
know he's a <a href="http://www.pinmall.com/images/mrpin/streetfight.jpg">street
fighter</a>, not a <a href="http://www.basketball.ca/">basketball</a> player, but then
again this <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/">isn't the
NBA</a>. After basketball and also after swimming today I'm
starting to notice I'm short of breath. I hope this is more
because of just being out of shape lately and less because of
something asthmatic.</p>
<p>On a complete sidenote, performing the <a href="http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/saveasthma.html">Heimlich</a>
maneuver can be good for asthma relief. I've become a bit of a
fan of <a href="http://pw1.netcom.com/~axleplus/stuff/veggie/celebs.html">Henry
Heimlich</a>, after seeing some TV specials on him. He advocates
<a href="http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/research.html">replacing
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with the Heimlich manuever</a>,
which actually makes sense once you see the statistics.</p>
<p>My other hero is <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/engelbart/index.jsp">Douglas
Engelbart</a>, inventor of the computer mouse and other things we
take for granted. His was the second computer on what would
become the Internet! Think about how useful a one-machine
Internet is for a bit. I can't really vouch for that last fact,
though, I just remember hearing about it once. Here I am
propogating a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/supervixen1003/soweird/deadpaul.html">
silly rumor</a>.</p>

			 <p>It's 3 AM and I'm writing this from in my bed.</p>
<p>Today was yet another fulfilling day at <a href="http://www.asee.org/prism/sept00/html/olin.cfm">Olin
College</a>. I finished up the <acronym title="American National Standards Institute">ANSI</acronym> C
Tutorial <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> job. Now
all I have to do is add all <a href="http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/600/610/614/solar-water/idrc/app17.html">
17 appendices</a>.</p>
<p>For lunch I had the best <a href="http://www.cooksrecipes.com/poultry/old-fashioned-chicken-pot-pie-with-mashed-potato-chive-crust-recipe.html">
chicken pot pie</a> ever. The top half was mashed potatoes. It
was a microwave version of course but it was quite tasty to say
the least. I washed it down with some <a href="http://www.reed.edu/~mcneilc/makeminemoxie.html">Moxie</a>,
the classic New England soda and oldest marketed <a href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/issues/v154n6/abs/poa90400.html">
carbonated beverage</a> in the United States. It leaves such a
bitter taste in your mouth, but it's <a href="http://www.baskinrobbins.com">so many differing flavors</a>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/1192/LyleLovett/cantresist.html">
you can't resist</a> taking another sip.</p>
<p>For dinner we all went to <a href="http://www.emunah.org/contacts.htm">Rachel Weinstock</a>'s
house. She's our <a href="http://www.northernpower.com/pages/financialdirector.html">Director
of Financial Services</a>. We had some burgers and hot dogs. We
had the inevitable discussion on how New England hot dog buns are
<a href="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/restaurants/articles/cheap_eats/surf.htm">
top-loading</a>, while everywhere else they are side-loading.</p>
<p>Yes, it's true.</p>
<p>We got back to the dorm and found that Ann Marie is back. <a href="http://students.olin.edu/nhori">Nicole</a> had arrived just
prior to the <a href="http://www.bocaburger.com/">barbecue</a>.
Thus begins the mass exodus of students back to Olin, culminating
in the first meeting of all 75 students (since <a href="http://www.olin.edu/news/weekend.html">Candidate
Weekend</a>) this Saturday.</p>
<blockquote class="newsupdate">

<p>The world is filled with <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/cruft.html">cruft</a>.
Sometimes I just sit back and notice how many things around us
are a product of ideas that were never really taken to full
fruition. The <a href="http://www.broehan-museum.de/metallw7.htm">cheap
silverware</a> I eat with isn't designed that well. The spoon is
very flat. They could have made the spoons much better, but they
didn't. They got lazy and put out a quick product. There is no
good reason the spoons couldn't have had a better curve to them.
Millions of <a href="http://www.davelippman.com/walmart/whyihatewalmart.html">Wal

			 <p>Insert first sentence here.</p>
<p>I saw the new campus today!!! I went to the Campus Center to
help <a href="http://students.olin.edu/sschwalbenberg">Sara</a>
move some boxes for the <a href="http://pages.emerson.edu/organizations/wecb/big/news/article1099.html">
Office of Student Life</a>. I got to look around quite a lot. We
didn't get to go to West Roxbury to pick up the Honor Code,
however. That would have been fun, although if we overshot and
went to Roxbury we would have been shot or something, at least
according to advice we were given.</p>
<p><a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a> is
playing <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/games/2001/e3expo-pcgames.html">
Warcraft III</a>. I was watching for a while. They play this map
called Save the WTC Beta! that is very sad. It's so bad, so
terrible. It's definitely <a href="https://www.somethingawful.com">something awful</a>.</p>
<p>I started packing my room up for the Big Move. Ten days from
now the updates will be coming from the Residence Hall on Olin
Way. Our buildings have the address "<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/1996/40/b3495118.htm">Olin
Way</a>" without any numbers. I've also seen versions that say
"1000 Olin Way", so I'm confused. I like the name though. It's
like, we do things the <a href="http://mgcs.micronpc.com/education/olin_college.html">Olin
Way</a>. As long as it's not some sort of <a href="http://www.scientology.com/">cult</a> we're doing OK.</p>
<p>I'm "<a href="https://www.esj.com/features/article.asp?EditorialsID=112">webifying</a>"
the Olin College C Tutorial on the job now. Maybe it will be
public, and people can learn C from the comforts of their own
homes. Of course there are a billion others out there, but I'm
sure people would come to ours because of the <a href="http://www.praystation.com">wonderful design</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/music/creedwtp4/me.html">Not
that you're interested or anything</a>.</p>
<p>Dan showed me this <a href="http://www.coudal.com/teaseform.php">webpage</a> that hosts
Photoshop competitions. Essentially some guy makes a <a href="http://nilbs.com/techbabl/image_bloat.htm">Photoshop</a>
pic, then the other guy fights back by editing the pic, then it
goes back and forth until there have been ten versions. There is
running commentary and score is awarded. All this in a <a href="http://www.deathclock.com">time limit</a>.</p>

<p>Or more accurately, it's not. While Joles, Kate, Will, and I
were returning from <a href="http://www.borders.com">Borders</a>,
we joked about roadkill. Our joking was a little premature, as
two minutes later we hit an opossum. <a href="http://www.applelinks.com/abacus/dead_opossum.shtml">Dead</a>.
At least it wasn't a <a href="http://www.johndeere.com">deer</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone at Olin has been enjoying their newfound <a href="http://latimes.p2ionline.com/treeprintads/0003776785-001/p1s3m.asp">
Borders coupons</a>. I bought <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk">Stereolab</a>'s latest album
(to my knowledge), <i>Sound-Dust</i>, for half price. Any
Stereolab album is worth buying. I own three now. Stereolab is a
little strange. I saw them with <a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a> and <a href="http://students.olin.edu/jfernandez">Jesus</a> earlier this
year at <a href="http://www.avalonboston.com">Avalon</a>. They
use <a href="http://www.moog.com">Moog</a> synthesizers and
trombones and normal instruments. Very well, I might add. Also,
whenever they release <a href="http://www.vinylinfo.org/index.html">vinyl</a> singles,
they only make a limited number. Sure, they've released dozens,
but every time you see one, it's like <a href="http://frugalliving.about.com/cs/consumeraddiction/">you
just gotta buy one</a>, since you'll never see that one again. I
have several I found in Europe, and one I found in Oklahoma
City.</p>
<p>Today I helped <a href="http://students.olin.edu/sschwalbenberg">Sara</a> make a
wonderful kickin' <a href="http://www.docobot.com/">Word
template</a>. It was freaking awesome.</p>
<p>The last <acronym title="Compact Disc">CD</acronym> I bought
before today was <a href="http://www.deadsy.com">Deadsy</a>'s
<i>Commencement</i>. Deadsy is a weird hybrid between 80s new
wave and late 90s-present quasi-goth <a href="http://www.numetalfinishing.com/">nu-metal</a>. They also
prominently feature synthesizers. The lead singer is P. Exeter
Blue, who just happens to be the son of <a href="http://www.cher.com">Cher</a> and <a href="http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,83,00.html"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Robert Altman</span></a>.
They do a cover of <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com">Rush</a>'s "<a href="http://www.tomsawyer.com">Tom Sawyer</a>" that has confused
many people into believing they were listening to the original.
Each band member has a color and theme. P. Exeter Blue's theme is
academia (how's that for a metal band?) and his color is <a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_761.html">
International Klein Blue</a>. Yes, <acronym title="International Klein Blue"><a href="http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/splashwords/international.html">

<p>Today work was slow. Tomorrow the stuff is moving to the real
campus! My job is quickly going to change. The Campus Center has
been given a temporary unofficial occupancy permit, to hold us
over until it gets the real one in a few days. This is a great
thing, since we need to move in and only have 14 days left before
classes start. The Classroom Building and Residence Hall are
still lagging. Let's home I have somewhere to live a week from
Saturday!</p>
<p>Erin emailed me yesterday. She said she heard from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sykoze/">TC</a>. I need to get in
contact with him. She said he might want to visit before school
starts, but at this rate it won't happen. Right now I'm
completely out of touch with him.</p>
<p>While at Borders, I looked through all the books. For some
reason, only science books interest me. I don't care for fiction.
I only like reading fact, especially about math, physics, or
computers. Music too, I guess. We really need a library. We have
a pretend library over in the <acronym title="Modular Academic Center">MAC</acronym> that carries <a href="https://www.2600.com">2600</a>. I think that's so cool.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.ecsusa.com/K7VTA3_3x.cfm">motherboard</a>'s
stupid built-in <a href="http://www.fartnet.com/soundwave/oldrants/rant1.html">sound
card</a> won't work. In Linux, at least. It autodetects it fine,
but then nothing happens and the sound server fails. Great. I'll
just go buy a cheapo <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/products/sb16pci/">Sound
Blaster 16</a>. Dan got this <a href="http://www.deadvirgins.org.uk/reborn/index.html">program</a>

			 <p>A change of pace would be nice.</p>
<p>I'm writing today's update from outside. I'm sitting on the
deck behind the <acronym title="Modular Residence Hall"><a href="http://www.modspace.com/case_studies/muhlenberg.html">Mod</a></acronym>.
The air is moist and clean, and it is still quite warm out, for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=12%3A45+AM">
12:45 AM</a> at least. I'm looking at the new campus, where I'll
be living in two weeks. I took some pictures of it, which I'll
try to post later, although it's very dark and they didn't come
out so well. Susan said some buildings were inspected the last
few days, but none have probably passed yet. Soon we will be
moving equipment over.</p>
<p>I wrote my learning plan today. Actually I only started it. I
have to have it done by Thursday to show to my advisor, Prof. <a href="http://www.dynetics.com/news/y02News/haysAward.htm">Mike
Moody</a>. It was more of just a draft. Probably I should be more
serious. Or not. I still have lots of time, relatively
speaking.</p>
<p>I have a theory. There are two types of people: car people and
computer people. I know this is an overgeneralization, but for
most cases there is something similar you can replace "<a href="http://www.aws.org/">car</a>" or "<a href="http://www.arrl.org/">computer</a>" with. Car people are
more inclined to involve themselves with corporeal physical
objects, while computer people are more abstract and work with
ideas. The distinction arose when I realized that while many
people <a href="http://www.hotrodhillbillies.com/">hotrod their
cars</a>, there is a growing class of people who <a href="http://www.hanaho.com/products/HotRodJoystick/">hotrod
their computers</a>. This may seem silly to traditionalists, but
then again, hotrodding cars seems silly to us <a href="https://www.slashdot.org">computerites</a>. For car people,
where you are is very important. Having a nice car can get you to
your friends' houses and into the city, or on <a href="http://www.travelocity.com">long vacations</a>. Likewise,
for computer people, the Internet can fulfill many of these
desires. Sure, no person wants to stick in front of the screen
all day, but computer people are more likely to look something up
in a <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">book</a> before they ask
someone else's opinion. Sometimes this book just happens to be
the Internet. Anyway, if you have any comments, please <a href="mailto:nertzy@cox.netREMOVETHIS">shoot them my way</a>, and
I might post them in an update here or work them into a more
permanent page. Adam and I applied this theory further, deciding
the difference holds equally true for <acronym title="Electrical Engineers"><a href="http://www.ieee.org/">EEs</a></acronym> and <acronym title="Mechanical Engineers"><a href="http://www.asme.org/">MEs</a></acronym>.</p>
<p>My other theory is that there is a nerd-jock spectrum, and if
you watch <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/index.html">
Conan</a> you're more towards the nerd side. Jocks tend to watch
<a href="https://www.cbs.com/latenight/latelate/">Craig
Kilborn</a>. That's just the way it is.</p>
<p>I just heard a train go by. These are the things you miss when
pent up inside all day.</p>
<p><a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a> has this
demo of a program from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com">NVidia</a>
that lets you type in an address anywhere on Earth and then zooms
in on it really close using satellite data. What sets this apart
from those <a href="http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/">satellite
websites</a> is the fact that the Earth is rendered in full 3D
and the zooming is entirely to scale. Dan can see the playset
thing in the backyard of his old house in Lake Forest, IL. You
can also see people waiting in line in front of the <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Pyramide_du_Louvre.html">
I.M. Pei pyramid</a> at the <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/">Louvre</a>. I have almost the same
<a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/cgi-bin/gbi.cgi/Pyramide_du_Louvre.html/cid_3028374.gbi">
picture</a> of Adam and Dan walking towards the Louvre pyramid
from the side. Oklahoma City is at a much lower resolution on the
Earth viewer, so you can't make out a lot of stuff.
Coincidentally, there is an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/travel/vacations/great/gardens.htm">
I.M. Pei structure</a> in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>Today I spent over $1000 of Olin's money. Well actually I <a href="http://www.digikey.com">ordered electrical supplies</a> for
Gill. He told me what to buy, but still it is nice placing a
four-digit cost order online over a <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/">wireless ethernet
connection</a>. Yes, I guess that makes me a computer person now,
doesn't it?</p>

			 <p>It has that certain I don't know what.</p>
<p>Today I slaved away in the <acronym title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</acronym> lab. <a href="http://students.olin.edu/wclayton">Will</a> and I spent
several hours clearing off all the benches so they can be shipped
up to <a href="http://www.realcampus.nu/">the real campus</a>
tomorrow morning. This was quite a laborious task. We found all
sorts of things from as early as <acronym title="Olin Parnter Year: Module I">Mod I</acronym>.</p>
<p><a href="http://students.olin.edu/jsatwicz">Jeff</a> and I
went to <a href="http://www.birchmire.com/Bagels.html">Bagels'
Best</a> for lunch. I had the roast beef bagel sandwich and boy
that mustard sure cleared my sinuses. The office sure is empty
lately, now that <a href="http://students.olin.edu/smunson">Sean</a> and <a href="http://students.olin.edu/ahorton">Adam</a> are gone. Adam
left his door unlocked. <a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a> put the Eazee
Squeeze jalapeño cheese food spread thing onto Adam's bed,
creating a fun surprise for him when he gets back.</p>
<p>I'll be getting my huge <a href="http://www.chemicalbrothers.com">Chemical Brothers</a>
poster in the mail soon. It's full subway ad size. <a href="http://www.paintinglight.net">Jesse</a> brought it back for
me from <a href="http://www.usc.edu"><acronym title="University of Southern California">USC</acronym></a> last
year.</p>
<p>I have been finding that very random people read this page.
For instance, my mom reads this. I find that very interesting
considering I didn't tell anyone about my page. Perhaps she saw
it in my <a href="https://www.aim.com"><acronym title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</acronym></a> profile. More
likely, Kyle showed it to her. I wouldn't put anything past her,
however, because she is one of the more <a href="http://www.austen.com/derby/hannah1b.htm">tech-savvy
mothers</a> out there.</p>
<p>We threw a surprise birthday party for <a href="http://students.olin.edu/kblazek">Kate</a> today.
Afterwards <a href="http://students.olin.edu/jarnold">Joles</a>
showed us her big whip. She has a big <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&amp;address=buggy+whip&amp;city=enid&amp;state=ok">
buggy whip</a> for some reason. We used it to break the sound
barrier.</p>
<p>I'm going to take off my socks. Socks make me feet incredibly
hot. That is frustrating. So I'll take them off.</p>
<p>I've been trying to avoid making these posts <a href="http://www.caa.lcs.mit.edu/~devadas/6.004/Lectures/lect9/sld017.htm">
tedious and boring</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Steve, Dan and I went to the <a href="http://www.birchmire.com/Firebird.html">Firebirds
Grill</a>. We all love Firebirds because they love us Olin kids.
The manager came over and chatted with us when she saw my Olin
shirt. It turns out that Olin's mascot is the most famous
firebird, the Phoenix. They have "Phoenix Wings" at Firebirds.
Also, we are both located in Needham. To add insult to injury,
Firebirds offers Frank's Hot Sauce on every table. Olin's first
name is Frank. Go figure.</p>
<p>Sheeva is cool. Go visit her <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/users/sheeva/">livejournal</a>
sometime. She's going to the <a href="http://www.addict.com/issues/5.12/spotlight/Le_Tigre.html">Le
Tigre</a> concert. GRRRRR!</p>
<p>OK, that's enough for today. Maybe later I'll tell you a fun
story from my past. I'm sorry that you guys have to put up with
the fact that I write these all late at night right before I go
to bed. It causes me to favor things that happen later in the day
and are fresher in my memory. Also, my mindset is generally the
same this late at night. Oh well, I have a day job.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> weekend is drawing to
a close as I completely gut my machine and put <a href="https://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> on it instead. Tomorrow
is work again so maybe I can put my head back into reality.</p>
<p>Today was generally slow. Lately the nerd in me has been
winning out somehow. Today was also <a href="http://www.startrek.com">Star Trek</a> watching night with
<a href="http://students.olin.edu/kblazek">Kate</a> and <a href="http://students.olin.edu/jarnold">Joles</a> on <a href="http://www.thenewtnn.com">The New TNN</a>. Lore used the <a href="http://www.worthynews.com/news-features/resistance-is-futile.html">
Borg</a> to capture Data. If you have no idea what I'm talking
about, all the better for you.</p>
<p>I'm up quite late and I have to work tomorrow so I should get
to sleep soon. I'm going to move the <acronym title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</acronym> lab in
two days, so tomorrow will be spent boxing up a great many
electronic "<a href="http://zippysscroll.tripod.com/">dealies</a>".</p>
<p>I went to the supermarket today and bought me some <a href="http://www.quakeroats.com/">Quaker Crunchy Corn Bran</a>,
continuing my <a href="http://www.asmallvictory.net/oldshit/000728.html">adult
no-fun cereal</a> theme. Last time it was <a href="http://www.grapenuts.com">Post Grape Nuts</a>. Looks like
I'll be getting my <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/cereal.htm">folic
acid</a>. Funny how I trust corn cereal products from a company
calling itself Quaker <em>Oats</em>.</p>
<p>I also bought some beverage called <a href="http://www.xensei.com/users/iraseski/WhatIs.html">Moxie</a>.
It's very strange looking, probably a cola of some sort. I'll get
back to you.</p>
<p>Austin went around <a href="http://www.okc-cityhall.org/">Oklahoma City</a> looking for
open 802.11b wireless networks. He found several, including one
near his house that was fairly easy to get into. He even found
pictures. Scary. They really aren't secure by default. Be sure to
use <acronym title="Wireless Encryption Protocol">WEP</acronym>
at the very least, even though it is weak.</p>

			 <p>Five for a <a href="https://store.yahoo.com/media-superstore/6flpmaxhdn.html">floppy</a>?</p>
<p>Today I went to the <a href="http://www.pcshow.com">PC
Show</a> and bought a bunch of stuff. I got a new case,
motherboard, power supply, processor, and floppy drive. And I
didn't buy a single one at the listed price. Let's hear it for <a href="http://www.msjudith.net/other/021199.htm">haggling</a>! I
feel like quite the barterer. For those of you who haven't tried
haggling, <a href="http://rushowners.se7ens.net/deanh1.htm">the
rush</a> that comes afterwards is infectious. Of course I used
this opportunity to live up to my nerd status and not only build
it myself, but also install <a href="https://www.suse.com">SuSE
Linux</a>. And not from some sissy CDs or DVD; I used three
floppies to get enough on there to install by FTP. So there!</p>
<p>Other than that I cleaned up one of our dryers. It turns out
that <a href="http://www.vayusa.com">Ajay</a>, our <acronym title="Resident Assistant">RA</acronym>, or more accurately the
guy who lives here and hasn't interacted with a single soul all
year, put his boots in the dryer, leaving it quite marked. This
was before I got here. The other students gave him an <a href="http://www.selfknowledge.com/102039.htm">ultimatum</a>. He
never did clean it up, however, so <a href="http://students.olin.edu/wclayton">Will</a> and I found
ourselves doing it instead. He just got back today from Oregon,
his home.</p>
<p>Adam is leaving tomorrow. Back to <a href="http://www.state.vt.us">Vermont</a>! He put together our <a href="http://recycle.olin.edu">recycling program</a>. <a href="http://students.olin.edu/lige">Leighton</a> is leaving too.
I think he said he's going to <a href="http://canada.gc.ca/">Canada</a>. His parents are in the
area for awhile, so he'll be pretty busy for the next week or
so.</p>
<p>Right now I'm installing lots of <a href="https://www.fsf.org">Free Software</a> using <a href="http://www.ximian.com/products/ximian_red_carpet/">Ximian
Red Carpet</a>. It's pretty easy. I like free things.</p>
<p>We watched <a href="http://lax.gaz.nu/wonka/">Willy Wonka and
the Chocolate Factory</a> today. Yes, we watched <a href="http://www.wonka.com/">Willy Wonka</a>. To be more
accurate, I slept through most of it.</p>
<p>A lot of people are gone this weekend. Sara, Susan (for a
while), Adam and Leighton (soon), Jeff (who lives at home <a href="http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/">5 miles away</a>, not here at
Olin), Steve and Susan (again) (just for the day tomorrow) (<a href="http://www.state.nj.us">New Jersey</a>), and Nicole. Will
better make up for them, being the only new arrival.</p>
<p>The school year is <a href="http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2000/december/pcr_tyranny.htm">
creeping up on us</a>. Everyone is so excited to see fresh new
faces. We're actually going to have enough people to have some
semblence of parties and clubs and social activities. We also
don't have to keep calling ourselves <a href="http://www.partners.org/">prefreshmen</a>. That got old
fast. Now we can pretend to be new freshmen <a href="http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/041901/dog_0419010033.shtml">
unadjusted to college life</a>.</p>

			 <p>It seems you know me both inside and out.</p>
<p>Today I ate at <a href="http://www2.bc.edu/~angelila/homework1.html">Cafe Sol
Azteca</a>, a pretty nice Mexican restaurant. I must say it's not
really a lot like the Tex-Mex I'm used to, so I assume it's more
like actual Mexico food. The name at least implies a more
centrally located Mexican cuisine. Mmm, <a href="http://www.differentworld.com/mexico/common/pages/history_notes/tenochtitlan.htm">
Tenochtitlan</a>. The salsa was milder and sweeter than my On The
Border fare from a couple days ago, and comes highly recommended.
I was pretty happy when Dan asked me how to say "beans" in
Spanish and I subconsciously thought "<a href="http://frijoles.hungry.com/">frijoles</a>". I don't know
very much Spanish, and I thought I was wrong, but <a href="http://students.olin.edu/cchavez">Chris</a> confirmed that
I was right.</p>
<p>Today we watched three episodes of <a href="http://www.trekdoc.com/">Star Trek</a>. I must admit
straightforwardly that I used to be <em>very</em> into Star Trek.
I know, I know. Well it was fun because everyone currently here
had seen pretty much every episode before so we had plenty of
opportunity to <a href="http://www.nitcentral.com/">heckle</a>
it. Being a proto-engineer causes me to see through the tech
mumbo-jumbo, but it's fun to watch nonetheless.</p>
<p>Work was pretty basic today. I spent 6.5 hours working on a
document. That can get old.</p>
<p>Now my mom is a finalist for <a href="http://www.millionairetv.com">Millionaire</a> also. She
drove up to Tulsa to take the <a href="http://www.millionairetv.com/auditions.html">test</a>, so
now both of my parents have a relatively small chance of making
it on to the now daily syndicated show. I hope it comes near
Boston soon!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'm going to the <a href="http://www.pcshow.com">PC
Show</a>. I'm going to check prices on <a href="https://www.newegg.com">New Egg</a> first. New Egg is a
great place to get components. I've only heard good reviews, and
the prices are reasonable if not superior. If I find cheaper
stuff at the show, however, I'm going for it.</p>
<p>The <acronym title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</acronym> lab is
moving from the <acronym title="Modular Academic Center">MAC</acronym> to campus on
Tuesday. This means I will quickly move from a desk job to a hard
labor job. I get to lug boxes!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com"><acronym title="Cable News Network">CNN</acronym></a> has a ton of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/wtc.ideas/">user-submitted
designs</a> for a <acronym title="World Trade Center">WTC</acronym> memorial. Most of them
are quite pitiful. Dan is constantly emailing me ones that outbad
the previous entries as they are released each day. In our
<acronym title="Art Independent Study">Art IS</acronym> class
during the <a href="http://www.olin.edu/news/yearend.html">Partner Year</a>,
several students and I designed <acronym title="World Trade Center">WTC</acronym> and Pentagon memorial
ideas. Mine was more of an idea than an actual physical design,
taking only a piece of paper in the stead of a real model.</p>
<p>I also built a <a href="http://www.thereminworld.com/">theremin</a> for the class.
The theremin is the first electronic instrument, which you play
by <a href="http://www.parascope.com/articles/1196/touch1.htm">waving
your hands</a> toward and away from a pitch antenna and a volume
antenna. It is very difficult indeed. You can play every tiny
microtone between notes, although that is difficult as there is a
four-octave range over about a foot and a half of space. This
makes for <a href="http://www.parascope.com/articles/1196/touch1.htm">crazy
glissandos</a>. Theremins were popularized (and trivialized) by
their use in 50s-era <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nc/deadskeletons/horror.html">cheesy
B horror</a> and space movies.</p>

			 <p>Drink from the punchbowl of knowledge.</p>
<p>Today my job required unusual things of me. I spent hours
helping to form some grading policy for our grading proposal. I
also listened to one of the <a href="https://www.monster.com">candidates</a> for the <a href="http://www.hotjobs.com">position</a> of our new <a href="http://www.roguelibrarian.net">librarian</a>. She gave us
all postcards with stamps on them so we could write back to her
in <a href="http://www.state.or.us">Oregon</a>. Great idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paintinglight.net">Jesse</a> has some cool
pictures on his site. You should check them out sometime. He once
did a photo shoot for the up-and-coming R&amp;B star <a href="http://www.sharissa.com">Sharissa</a>. Right now he goes to
<a href="http://www.usc.edu">USC</a> and is a film major.</p>
<p>Earlier today I promised myself that I wouldn't spend so much
time on <a href="http://www.sorabji.com/2002/july/14/">mundane
details of my life</a> and devote more time to abstract thoughts.
<a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a> and I have
long abstract discussions into the wee hours pretty much every
night. Right now I'm spending the wee hours writing this,
however. Of course I don't know what abstract is supposed to mean
in this context. Maybe I'll just tell old stories instead.</p>
<p>I'm listening to <a href="http://www.beck.com">Beck</a>'s <a href="http://www.odelay.com/">Odelay</a> right now. My fifth
album ever. Dan is talking to me about some <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/">Flash</a> museum
installation they have in <a href="http://www.iheartny.com/">New
York City</a>. It reminds me of the <a href="http://www.praystation.com">Praystation</a> exhibit at <a href="http://www.ilovelondon.com/">London</a>'s <a href="http://www.designmuseum.org/">Design Museum</a>. Joshua
Davis is a Flash master. He pretty much rules the world while
everyone else catches up. He once sold the entire contents of his
hard drive, including personal files and unreleased Flash code,
in a limited-edition box set.</p>
<p>While at the museum, I bought a book about fontography. I hope
to write a font someday. I might be able to convince <a href="http://www.olin.edu">the college</a> to give me credit for
it. (or perhaps just recognition on my transcript)</p>
<p>Every student currently at Olin went to <a href="http://www.olin.edu/news/news_stories/rod.html">Rod</a>'s
house today. <a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~lexfri/thoughts.html">Rod
Crafts</a> is our Dean of Student Life. He has a wonderful
backyard that is on a small cliff and has many levels of ground
with chairs set up so you can look down over the gardens below.
We had burgers.</p>
<p>The new students (and all the old ones too) arrive in a couple
weeks. We all can't wait.</p>
<p>Look for some of <a href="http://www.mp3.com/citron">my
music</a> over the next few days on this site. I've been meaning
to make a new section dedicated to my music and some MP3s. The <a href="http://www.riaa.org">RIAA</a> can just cry, because they
have no power over my music. I used to go by the moniker <a href="http://john.bonobo.free.fr/citron1.htm">Citron</a>, but now
I'm just simply Grant Hutchins. Keep that in mind when referring
to my music. I've been meaning to tell <a href="http://www.normalform.com">Jon</a> about this for some time
now.</p>
<p>Speaking of, Jon asked me for the original <a href="https://www.adobe.com/photoshop">Photoshop</a> file for one
of the little <a href="http://www.normalform.com/nfbg.gif">logos</a> on his <a href="http://www.normalform.com">page</a>. He's making stationery
I heard. Watch out for some new stuff soon.</p>
<p>While I'm in the mood for plugging old friends, check out <a href="http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com">Tucker</a>'s new
<a href="http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com/djmixes.php">DJ
mix</a>, "Trance 8.8.02". He's amazing at mixing. My favorite
transition is the one in "Electronic 5.28.02" from <a href="http://www.crystalmethod.com">Crystal Method</a>'s "Busy
Child" to <a href="http://www.loopz.co.uk">Orbital</a>'s
"<acronym title="&quot;August&quot; in Gaelic">An Fhomhair</acronym>".
Simply amazing stuff.</p>

			 <p>Yet another day at the school called Olin.</p>
<p>I worked again today, as usual. Part of the day was spent
watching a video of crazily efficient wooden wall-mounted kinetic
sculptures with some classmates and <a href="http://www.asee.org/precollege/flowers.cfm">Woodie
Flowers</a>. One of the cohorts at Olin will be working on
kinetic sculptures similar to these but most undoubtedly less
ambitious. The sculptures from the video could run for ten hours
on a tiny wind of a wheel.</p>
<p>Nicole was going to fly to Oregon today, but when her plane
took off, one of the engines started emitting flames so it landed
and she has to fly out tomorrow very early in the morning. She
talked very nonchalantly about it.</p>
<p>This summer I didn't do much of consequence. One thing I am
proud of, however, was working with <a href="http://www.normalform.com">Jon</a> on an anti-drug <acronym title="Public Service Announcement">PSA</acronym> television
commercial he made. He's going to try to sell it to companies or
churches to put their logo on in the final scene. I went to see
him at <acronym title="Oklahoma City Community College">OCCC</acronym> and we
went to lunch at <a href="http://www.tacobell.com">Taco Bell</a>.
Afterwards, I created a sound file for them to use in the video.
It was the sound of a coffin closing, followed by an echo. I made
the sound from a bass drum dropped a couple octaves. It was a fun
task; hopefully I can work like this in the future, possibly for
pay. I did get a 2-channel <a href="http://www.geminidj.com/">Gemini</a> mixer out of the whole
deal.</p>
<p>I broke out the first large jar of <a href="http://www.ontheborder.com/">On The Border</a> salsa today.
It has a very meaty, rich flavor to it. I highly suggest it if
it's sold in your area. <a href="http://www.logicalrealist.com">Sean</a> sure seemed to like
it. I think he's addicted like me.</p>
<p>Only 18 days until the new freshmen come! I just realized the
school will more than double (from 30 to 75) this year, and it
will also more than double (75 to ~175) next year. What school
does that?</p>
<p>On Saturday I'm going to the <a href="http://www.pcshow.com">PC Show</a> to look for parts for my
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> desktop server I plan on
purchasing. Dan and I spent hours trying to set up his NVidia
card some more, with no luck.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://students.olin.edu/sschwalbenberg">Sara</a> and I
went out onto the back deck and did something odd. She took a
measuring bowl full of 2 cups of water and poured some on the
bottoms of my feet. I think walked around and she looked at the
footprints to note how flat my feet are. We then both stepped in
a puddle thus formed and did a <a href="http://www.mysimon.com">side-by-side comparison</a>.</p>
<p>For lunch I made mashed potatoes, but put too much water in it
(continuing the <a href="http://www.sally-save-water.com/">wasteful water use</a>
theme). Luckily I had some potato chips to crumble and put into
it. It may sound odd but I enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>Work is already becoming routine.</p>
<p>Today I fleshed out the papers I've been writing for
explanation of thermocouples, <acronym title="Operation Amplifiers">op-amps</acronym>, and duty cycles.
I also talked to my mom about how she and my dad tried out for
Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? They took a 30 question multiple
choice test. After that the people who did well enough passed to
the next round. My dad made it! They interviewed him (he said it
went well), and if he is accepted he'll receive a postcard. One
of the ladies there was disqualified for having been on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Weakest_Link/">The Weakest Link</a>.</p>
<p>I lost my wallet and spent all day looking for it. It was next
to my alarm clock.</p>
<p>We ate at <a href="http://www.bertuccis.com/">Bertucci's</a>
in Wellesley today. I couldn't pay because I had lost my
wallet.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/visorprism/">Handspring
Visor Prism</a> is hosed. I dropped it and now the backlight
doesn't work at all. Everything else works fine. I'm going to see
if it's cheap to fix it. If not, I'll try myself or get Prof.
Gill Pratt to help me perhaps. I sure miss the poor sucker. (the
Visor, not Gill. I see Gill daily; he employs me.)</p>
<p><a href="http://students.olin.edu/lige">Leighton</a> finished
the Partner Year DVD. It looks very nice. Dan made a wonderful 3D
intro in <a href="http://www.discreet.com/products/3dsmax/">3D
Studio Max</a> based on the <a href="http://www.universalstudios.com/">Universal Pictures</a>
logo. Leighton managed to fit all six episodes of <a href="http://projects.olin.edu/marsport/hist_n_myst.html">The
History and Mystery of Mars</a> on there. I made the menus for
it, so I'm happy, although maybe it wasn't such a good idea to
stay up until 3:30 am last night to do it.</p>

			 <p>Today was the first day I've ever worked.</p>
<p>I now have a job at <a href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin</a>. I
spent today working with <a href="http://www.logicalrealism.org">Sean</a> to write up a lab
exercise for next year and order materials for it on the
budget.</p>
<p>I worked for a good deal of the day, then Elizabeth, Prof.
Joanne Pratt's daughter, came and I attempted to help babysit
her. She's only a year old and cries at the sight of me, so I
gave up for now.</p>
<p>Dan and I used <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Adobe
Photoshop 7</a> to brainstorm some layouts for our new dorm room
once the school year starts. The Residence Hall is essentially
complete, and we should be moving in less than three weeks.</p>
<p>Tomorrow my parents are going to the <a href="http://www.okczoo.com/">Oklahoma City Zoo</a> to try out
for <a href="http://www.millionairetv.com/">Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?</a>. My mom has been a finalist to appear on the
show before, but missed only one question over the phone in the
final qualifying round. This time around I think she has a good
chance. It's the new syndicated Millionaire, sans <a href="http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,46280,00.html">

			 <p>Happy birthday, Mom!</p>
<p>Today started out with Dan and I attempting to configure his
new install of <a href="https://www.suse.com">SuSE Linux</a> to <a href="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/mini/Nvidia-OpenGL-Configuration/index.html">
support 3D rendering</a> with his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com">NVidia</a> GeForce4. Soon after
that, Dan left to go to the <a href="http://www.fte.org/">Foundation of Teaching Economics</a>
dinner over at <a href="http://www.babson.edu">Babson College</a>
Needham/Wellesley Room. His aunt helped found it or something
like that, so he got a free dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://students.olin.edu/nhori">Nicole</a> asked me
if I wanted to go to the wildlife refuge with her, so I did. The
strange Brazilian driving instructor wasn't there, so Nicole was
happy. Anyway, we discovered that you're supposed to pay to enter
and that the refuge actually has nine miles of trails, not just
the quarter- to half-mile or so we expected. We saw some turtles
and various other wildlife, including menacing flies that drove
us out.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the Dan and I got another free dinner
across the parking lot at the <acronym title="Modular Academic Center">MAC</acronym>. Leslie organized a
dinner from <a href="http://www.vinnytestas.com/">Vinny
Testa's</a> so that we could discuss how to get ready for
internship opportunities next year. After that, Leighton, Dan,
Steve, Chris and I joined Jeff and Katie to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0295178">Austin Powers 3</a>,
which wasn't sold out this time. Austin Powers movies are
becoming <a href="http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/americasfunniest/">methodical
and unfunny</a> in some parts, although we had a fun time.</p>

			 <p><p>The <a href="http://www.areafestival.com">Area 2 Festival</a>
was great! Let me run down what it was like.</p>
<p>First I came in and barely missed <a href="http://www.djdieselboy.com/">Dieselboy</a>&rsquo;s set in the <a href="https://www.playstation.com">Playstation 2</a> DJ tent,
which was disappointing since I generally prefer jungle to
trance, but then <a href="http://www.djtiesto.com/">DJ
Tiësto</a> came in and was pretty good, but I decided to
leave to see the entire <a href="http://www.blueman.com">Blue Man
Group</a> show on the main stage. Their show was pretty good,
full of crazy percussion madness, although the audience
participation doesn&rsquo;t work with that size of an audience. It was
a little awkward at times. Hungry, I ate an expensive and
misnomered &ldquo;Chicken Sandwich Deluxe&rdquo;, which consisted of a slab
of tough chicken on a bun. Hits the spot every time. After we
learned that <a href="http://www.bustarhymes.com">Busta
Rhymes</a> wasn&rsquo;t going to show, <a href="http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com">Tucker</a>, <a href="http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist">Dan</a>, and I
returned to the tent to see <a href="http://www.johndigweed.com">John Digweed</a>, the
number-one-rated DJ in the world by most accounts. He was really
good, and I found myself able to enjoy his style of music, even
though I&rsquo;m usually not up for it. I was dancing pretty heavily,
so my glasses flew off my face twice. After I was sufficiently
tired Dan and I caught the end of <a href="http://www.davidbowie.com/">David Bowie</a>&rsquo;s set. A lot of
people there completely loved it, but I just sorta liked it. I&rsquo;m
not the Bowie type but it was good. After that I caught some <a href="http://www.carlcox.com">Carl Cox</a> in the tent which was
also quite fun, but only stayed for a few minutes because of the
important matter at hand:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moby.com">Moby</a>.</p>
<p>Moby was great, as usual. I&rsquo;ve seen him before, with Bush in
the Campus Invasion tour in Norman, OK. This time around he was a
lot funnier. He had a Krusty sticker from the Simpsons on his
guitar. He also put on a wig and acted like a metal guy for a
while. He was a lot more interesting this time around, even if he
didn&rsquo;t play &ldquo;All I Need Is To Be Loved&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oil 1&rdquo;, two of my
favorite songs. He didn&rsquo;t jump on top of his keyboard or play a
very long guitar solo, but otherwise it was Moby at his best. The
first encore he played was a quick cover of the &ldquo;Hey ho! Let&rsquo;s
go!&rdquo; punk song. The whole night you could tell he really wanted
to cover something (other than just the &ldquo;James Bond Theme&rdquo; as
usual) He ended with &ldquo;Feeling So Real&rdquo; just like last time, so I
was happy to say the least.</p>
<p>Right now after the show Dan, Leighton, Chris and I are
drinking <a href="http://drinks.glowport.com/942.html">virgin
margaritas</a> and listening to mellow jazz on <a href="http://streams.wgbh.org/wgbh/">&lsquo;GBH</a>. All and all a very
good day, although expensive for sure.</p>

			 <p><p>I&rsquo;m back at <a href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin</a> and I&rsquo;ll
probably be starting work on Monday. I had the hardest time
trying to change this webpage from <a href="http://www.state.ok.us">Oklahoma</a>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to the <a href="http://www.areafestival.com">Area 2</a> festival. It will
last from 3:30 pm on to probably the wee hours, and features <a href="http://www.moby.com">Moby</a>, David Bowie, Busta Rhymes,
and <a href="http://www.blueman.com">Blue Man Group</a>. I&rsquo;ve
already seen Moby and Blue Man Group before. When I went to the
Moby show I bought a Moby t-shirt. When I went to the Blue Man
Group show I wore that shirt, because I figured they would like
Moby. Later that year, after both of them got much more famous,
they performed together at the Grammy Awards. I think they saw my
shirt and put two and two together. Anyway, now Moby has selected
Blue Man Group to be in his second Area Festival, and it&rsquo;s all
thanks to my shirt.</p>
<p>Dan, Steve, Chris and I went to the Framingham 15 theater to
see Austin Powers 3. It was still sold out, so we left. Dan just
told me something interesting about the Framingham 15, which has
one of the less than 20 all-digital screens in the country. It
turns out the AMC Framingham 15 was once the General Cinemas 16.
It turns out this theater also has one of the two &ldquo;luxury&rdquo;
theaters that serve alcohol. When AMC bought the facility out,
says Dan, who is only moderately sure of this, they were only
given 15 of the theaters, the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; theater staying with
General Cinemas. You learn something new everyday.</p>
<p>Dan also showed me <a href="http://www.halfbakery.com">Half
Bakery</a>, a place where you can brainstorm ideas and then
people vote on them. I then showed him <a href="http://www.everything2.com">everything2</a>, a strange
mish-mash of writeups on any topic imaginable. In fact, if you
imagine something that isn&rsquo;t there, you get to write it up
yourself.</p>
<blockquote class="newsupdate">
<div class="updatedate">August 4, 2002</div>
<div class="updatetext">It turns out that AMC bought out General
Cinemas; we were wrong. They are all owned by the same company
now. It&rsquo;s the <a href="http:/www.ddrfreak.com/locations/locations.php?action=displayLocation&amp;locationID=629">
AMC Framingham 16</a>.</div>

			 <p>I stayed home all day today. My aunt and uncle and two cousins came over. We ate barbecue then played a lot of ping pong. Today my dad invited me to come along with him to go see the U.S. Open in Tulsa this Tuesday. I was very excited, until I found out it was the golf U.S. Open and not the tennis one. Oh well. Tennis and golf are the only sports I can stand to watch on television, but I don&rsquo;t think I could watch golf live without going crazy. We also watched the NBA Finals Game 3. We made fun of <a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0116756">Shaq</a> and his rap career and the Shaq Fu video game. We also watched Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and the timeless favorite cable auction. After the relatives left, I retired to my room and downloaded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redhat.com">Red Hat Linux</a>, which took a very long time. This day was a little more laid back and relaxing than the rest. So there.</p>

			 <p>Today I went to the Omniplex with Veronica, Jason, and Leigh Ann. My favorite part was the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iphf.org">International Photography Hall Of Fame</a>. I find it strange that it&rsquo;s at the Omniplex, but it has some really cool prints and some old cameras. We also rode the Geovator and did a lot of the now silly-seeming experiments. Man, I used to so love them! Afterwards we ate at the Macaroni Grill, where there are people singing opera quite often. I ordered Insalata Con Pollo. Very good. We then ventured onward to the Paseo. There wasn&rsquo;t anything going on there at all, so we ventured to 23rd and found out Vintage Plus and Rainbow Records were closed. We then hit CD Outlet where we met Jon and Alexandra (his girlfriend). I spent 10 dollars buying 4 oldskool rave CDs, including two by Quadrophonia, which includes one of the members of T-99. Wow. That&rsquo;s fun. Then we went to Jon&rsquo;s and watched a pirated Freddy Got Fingered bootleg video CD on his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sega.com">Sega Dreamcast</a>. The first Video CD ended, but the second one wouldn&rsquo;t play, so we watched cable auction instead. The knife table really sucked. They had this Confederate knife that we all didn&rsquo;t think was very cool. Then Veronica, Jason, and Leigh Ann headed home, and so did I. When I got home I played my brother some Street Fighter Alpha 2 emulated on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mameworld.net">MAME</a>. Then I went downstairs and wrote out a week&rsquo;s worth of News page entries with the recently regained Internet connection. Another full day of fun. Life is good.</p>

			 <p>Woke up when Jon complained loudly to Jesse not to make meow noises and wake him up. Perhaps I should have told Jon not to make loud complaining noises so as to not wake <i>me</i> up. I went home that morning and looked at the new 1 GHz <a target="_blank" href="http://www.compaq.com">Compaq</a> we bought cheap from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.overstock.com">overstock.com</a> It needed a network card, so we bought one at the wondeful CompUSA. Stephanie called and invited us to Eischen&rsquo;s, a supposedly-really-good chicken joint in Okarche. I was all for it, and eventually Jon, Austin, and I set out. But then Jon got kinda mad when we were following Stephanie&rsquo;s other friends on the way there and decided to ditch them. We drove by a cool abandoned farm instead. We decided to eat at Del Rancho&rsquo;s, of all places. I called Veronica and she and Jason came up to visit us. We watched some cable auction. We then ventured to the abandoned farm again. After that we hit Taco Cabana and went to Jon&rsquo;s, and they left. I decided to go home as well at this time. Another fun day with Veronica and Jason. Veronica then invited us all to the Omniplex for tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>This was a very fun day. Jon asked me to visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mileofcarsnorman.com">Norman</a> with him. We went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ou.edu">OU</a> to look at their film program. It wasn&rsquo;t so impressive. Jon is strongly considering OCCC instead, which has a nice new video production program with updated technology. Nate helps out with it too. Then I called Sheeva when we were done so we could hang out like I told her we would sometime. She wasn&rsquo;t there so I called Veronica. She was at OU! We met up with her, her twin sister Erica, and friends Jason and Leigh Ann at the Union building. We watched Jason eat <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chick-fil-a.com/">Chick-Fil-A</a>. Then we stopped by Sonic to redeem some Sonic dollars, since Jon has about ten million sitting around he got as a graduation present. Then we went to &ldquo;the park.&rdquo; Jason helped designed some of the kids&rsquo; playground equipment areas and he showed us his input. We swang on the swings and Veronica discovered that her older sister Amy got into a wreck. This is a recurring theme, as Erica wrecked a couple days earlier. Let&rsquo;s all hope the trend doesn&rsquo;t continue in the Edwards family. We then went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.borders.com">Borders</a> where Josh and Sheeva write their haikus. We rummaged around there for awhile, then spent too long in the parking lot plotting our next move. We went back to Sonic to spend more Sonic dollars, then back to the park, it now being night. We just sat around in the park until about 12:00 and then came home. It may not sound like much but this was one of the funnest days I&rsquo;ve had in a while. At Jon&rsquo;s house, Jesse had brought over his brand-new refurbished used iMac. It is very cool. We got it to say what people IMed us out loud, which entertained Jon and me until 5 in the morning. Thence we partook in sleep.</p>

			 <p>Today I went to the orthodontist. I checked out OK. Then he took an x-ray of my wisdom teeth to help in removing them. Little did I know (OK, I did know, but I forgot) that I already had one done at the dentist over Spring Break, and that I don&rsquo;t need them out, at least yet. I hope never to get them out. This is one thing that really bothers me. I know I will evenutally give in, however, no harm done. Afterwards I got an oil change, or as I told Jon and Austin, a &ldquo;lube job&rdquo;. They gave me funny looks. We then went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.compusa.com">CompUSA</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a> to look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com">Macs</a>. Macs are very cool all of a sudden. They are good for digital video editing, which is why Jon and Jesse both are getting them. We also stopped by Guitar Center and played with synths and drum machines like we always do. Then I got a lime slush and Sonic and went home.</p>

I checked out fine in my college physical. I guess Olin can let me come now. I need to get my Hepatitis B shots still. They gave me a tourniquet and drew blood. How fun! Afterwards Mother and I picked up Kyle from Driver Ed. He then drove us to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tacobell.com">Taco Bell</a> and we made him order drive-thru. I got the Nachos BellGrande. Good eatin&rsquo;. A little later, my good buddy Nate asked if I&rsquo;d help network the computers he uses with Lifetime Video Productions, his other job besides running his own production outfit. We bought a couple of wires and meanwhile tried to think of a good new name for Real Life Productions, since we might change the name and web address. Nothing conclusive. At home, we didn&rsquo;t have Internet access, for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.home.com">@Home</a> hadn&rsquo;t updated our connection for our brand new cable modem yet. Instead we had to do real family-type things such as play the board game Omega Virus, which is very fun. After that I went to eat at IHOP with Kamaria and Josh and Josh&rsquo;s Kelsey. Too many people have the same name, and I always find it funny when they become &ldquo;owned&rdquo; like that for clarity.</p>

			 <p>Discovered that there isn&rsquo;t much to do on a Monday in Oklahoma City. I met up with Veronica and we saw <i>O Brother Where Art Thou?</i> It was a very good movie in my opinion. Afterwards we went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chilis.com/">Chili&rsquo;s</a> to eat. We then commenced in aimlessly driving around noticing that there is little to do on a Monday. We went up north and adventured around Waterloo. All and all a fun night.</p>

			 <p>Today I went to Jesse&rsquo;s again, to see A@ron&rsquo;s play he put on at Occidental. It was (and still is, I guess) entitled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masturbation.iscool.net">&ldquo;America and Masturbation: A Play About Sex&rdquo;</a>. It was somewhat awkward watching it with such people as Jesse&rsquo;s parents and his grandmother, but it was fun nonetheless. Jesse&rsquo;s grandmother is a psychologist, and has been practicing for well over 60 years now, which I find amazing. After the show I hung out with Jesse and we went with his father, grandmother, and A@ron to <a href="http://www.soupersalad.com">Souper! Salad!</a>. I had never eaten at one before. They are very wonderful. You can get so much food for not very many moneys (inside cable auction joke). The only thing that surprised me was that they had much fewer soup options than they did salad ones. We then high-tailed it over to Jon&rsquo;s. Jesse and I performed an experiment. We both left at the same time from his house and took two different routes to get to Jon&rsquo;s. I took May, he took the Hefner Parkway. We tied. It didn&rsquo;t really help Jesse out like he had hoped. Tough luck. Then Jesse, Austin, Jon and I did something that I am sure will shock you all. We ate at the Edmond Whataburger. Yes, yet another Whataburger. What can I say? It&rsquo;s a great place. Then I went home to sleep, as usual.</p>

			 <p>Where to begin&hellip;? I woke up this morning when my aunts came over, with my little cousin Shayla. She&rsquo;s the coolest. She&rsquo;s only about 2 I think and she told me when I was banging the drums to &ldquo;stop making so many noises.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a little smartie! After that I headed over to Jesse&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s residence, where I watched Jesse&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s videos. A@ron does sketch comedy in a troupe at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oxy.edu">Occidental College</a>, the &ldquo;Sketchy People.&rdquo; We then went to Jesse&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s residence to see what A@ron got Jesse for his graduation. It was a toilet. A@ron filmed Jesse and me as we sprayed it with a hose. For about 45 minutes. We also pretended like sticks were our arms and beat the toilet with them. And then this kid walked up with a Super Soaker, so Jesse made him squirt the toilet in the front yard. Oh yeah, and it was filled with red paint. After that we went to Casady&rsquo;s graduation. They have bagpipes instead of Pomp and Circumstance and a &ldquo;Senior speaker&rdquo; instead of a Valedictorian. At the fun reception thing afterwards, this girl came up to me. I remembered her from the Casady last-day-of-school party in which we had our picture taken for some reason. She told me that it was developed and came out well and then told me she&rsquo;d mail it to me and walked off. I don&rsquo;t know how she knows where I live, and I thought she didn&rsquo;t even have my last name. Creepy. After graduation, I went to Aimee&rsquo;s house. For those of you who are less informed, Aimee is the friend of Jackie, who is Jesse&rsquo;s girlfriend. I&rsquo;ve never really hung out with them before, and we had fun. We went to the coffeehouse by Galileo&rsquo;s and played 20 questions. The things we had to guess: Dennis Rodman, herniated disc, space shuttle Challenger, and big turtle. Stephanie came with her friend Cole and hung out for a little while. Then we went back to Aimee&rsquo;s and watched <i>The Way of the Gun</i> which is too complicated for my tastes. I then went home at 2:30am and ate my first food of the day except for a couple pieces of pizza. Ay caramba!</p>

			 <p>Spent the night at Jon&rsquo;s, woke up around 12:30. Then we wrote a song. It was OK, but too &ldquo;busy.&rdquo; Lots of drum parts. Maybe I&rsquo;ll filter it out later. Maybe not. Then I went home and downloaded a lot of games for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MAME</a> (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator). Wes invited me to see The Animal with him and some people, and I was going to go, but I took too long getting ready and missed it. So I stayed home. I ripped out the ol&rsquo; Sega Genesis for some old school gaming action, but then Jon came over and we wrote some more songs. I wrote a really cool one by myself while Jon was here, too. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put it up here to listen to. It&rsquo;s more <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rephlex.com/">experimental</a>.</p>

			 <p>Before I spent the night at Jon&rsquo;s, we ate at another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whataburger.com/">Whataburger</a>. The same manager from the first Whataburger was working there now. Larry Brust. He is a really cool guy. He stopped me as I was leaving and told me to have a good day. Whataburger is so much better. They cook the burgers right when you order them. No heat lamps! Then we watched Traffic. Very good movie. Jon fell asleep so he missed out. We also stole Alexandra&rsquo;s guitar from her (with her permission) so Jon and I could write some music. We never got around to it today.</p>

			 <p>Woke up a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coleman.com/">happy camper</a>. Didn&rsquo;t do a darn thing all day for once. Talked to Josh for a long time about nothing. That was the extent of my evening. I had a long discussion with Justin Coleman overnight. I know a lot of my friends don&rsquo;t get along with him, but I think he&rsquo;s a nice guy. So there. Went to sleep much too late as usual.</p>

			 <p>Josh called me at 8:30 or something. I forgot to call back. He called me about an hour after I went to sleep. And Erin woke up four and a half hours before I went to sleep. How odd. Brian, Kamaria, Erin, and I hung out today. We went to Arby&rsquo;s, McDonald&rsquo;s, Wherehouse Music (on May), Sonic, and Barnes and Noble. Yes, three restaurants. I got a 42 cent 42 ounce drink, then spilled it. Jon did that the other day, too. Out of the 4 I&rsquo;ve seen bought, 2 have spilled. Them&rsquo;s bad odds. We drove by the infamous Whataburger (still closed for the power outages) and there were several <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ci.okc.ok.us/ocfd/">fire trucks</a> around it, inexplicably. Some guys were talking in front of one of them. Nothing appeared to be wrong. Then ten minutes later they sped by with sirens blaring to go somewhere more important(?). At Barnes and Noble I bought a book called &ldquo;An ABC of Music&rdquo; by Imogen Holst (daughter of Gustav Holst, who did <i><a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/features/planets/planetsfeat.html">Planets</a></i>). It&rsquo;s a music theory book. I hope to learn from it. I didn&rsquo;t read too far, then the tornadoes hit. Deadly tornadoes. They didn&rsquo;t hit us though. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe there weren&rsquo;t any tornadoes at all. I didn&rsquo;t check. Then I went to sleep.</p>

			 <p>Jim dropped by. He has the back of his neck pierced. Then nothing happened all day. Then I went to Jon&rsquo;s for Memorial Day. We had brisket and discussed our summer plans and what we were thankful for. I was thankful for our veterans and for plastics. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gepolymerland.com/">Plastics</a> make it possible. Then I stayed at Jon&rsquo;s until around 11:30 when we left to go to TV network parking lots. We went to Channel 4, but this guy with what was possibly a kidney in a cooler told us they weren&rsquo;t open. He and the bellboy then stared at us. Who knows? Then we met Jesse at the Whataburger that was closed. The 24-hour Whataburger was closed! So we went to Wal-Mart. Then I stayed up until 6:30 at Jon&rsquo;s then went home. Full day.</p>

			 <p>Today I spent 5 hours (!) at CD Outlet. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, CD Outlet is essentially where all the overflow CDs that don&rsquo;t sell at CD Warehouse go to. I ended up buying 6 albums (for only 20 dollars total!). One was <a target="_blank" href="http://album.yahoo.com/shop?d=ha&amp;id=1801586803&amp;cf=10&amp;intl=us">T99 - &ldquo;Children of Chaos&rdquo;</a> which is about the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a long time. Too bad it was their only album. I can&rsquo;t believe I wasted so much time there today though. I found a lot of weird stuff including a Buddhist-monk-style chant CD of songs such as &ldquo;The Monkees Theme&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hey, Hey! We&rsquo;re the Monks! People say we monkey around! But we&rsquo;re too busy chanting, to put anybody down!&rdquo;) and even Smells Like Teen Spirit. Didn&rsquo;t get it, but I&rsquo;ll buy it next time though.</p>

			 <p>Hung out with Veronica today. We drove all around. We must have passed Martin Luther King Blvd about a million times. Also I got to see the Myriad Botanical Gardens for the first time. That Crystal Bridge sure is a weird thing. It was designed by I. M. Pei. He designed the pyramid at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.louvre.fr/">Louvre</a> also. I wonder how he ended up doing something for, of all places, Oklahoma City?</p>

After that I went to a Casady end-of-school party, and this time everyone seemed to recognize me. But we left when it got pretty crappy. It was at this house way out east that was all fancy architecturally. We (Jon, Austin, and I) passed out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsync.com">N*SYNC</a> stickers to everyone. (My dad gave them to us, oddly enough, right before we left.
