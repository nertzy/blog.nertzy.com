			 <p>I&rsquo;ve finally decided to look into <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>. I know I will love it! I have started doing the <a href="https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans">Elixir Koans</a></p>
<p>But the yak-shaving has already taken over. I haven&rsquo;t even completed the first koan yet. Instead, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made a <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com/pull/1709">pull request</a> to update a link on the Elixir homepage pointing to a site taken over by spam.</li>
<li>Noticed that I don&rsquo;t have a good editor for Elixir</li>
<li>Decided to try out <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a> as a replacement for my Vim setup</li>
<li>Discovered <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> and started trying it out as a replacement for Terminal.app (at home) and iTerm (at work)</li>
</ul>
<p>But I&rsquo;m having fun! And I will have some free time next week to dig deeper into all of these things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ten years ago today, I pair programmed with Petra Jaros on the first commit for <a href="https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search" title="pg_search repository on GitHub">pg_search</a>, my Ruby gem.</p>
<p>Back then, I was working at <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs" title="Pivotal Labs, now part of VMware">Pivotal Labs</a> in New York on the <a href="https://www.casebook.net" title="Casebook PBC, formerly Case Commons">Casebook</a> project when we were having trouble with a search engine deployment. My client product manager trusted me to spend a month or so of full-time billable hours to put together a new solution to take advantage of the built-in search capabilities of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">PostgreSQL</a>. We open-sourced it, I wrote a <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/pg-search-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-postgresql-full-text-search" title="Blog post announcing pg_search">blog post</a> to announce its release, and before long we started to receive improvements from the community.</p>
<p>For the last ten years, I have maintained pg_search as a personal side project, for fun. I have learned quite a bit from maintaining the gem. Every once in a while, our test suite reveals a bug in Rails, which has been fun to investigate and try to fix. In my current job, I was recently able to use pg_search to build a type-ahead autocompleter.</p>
<p>Over the years I have released 62 versions of the gem. Most shocking of all, pg_search has been downloaded over 7.6 million times. I am humbled that the Ruby community has been so willing to use my work and contribute improvements over the years. I love free software, and it feels great to both give and receive.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the other software developers who have reported issues, submitted pull requests, and asked questions on our mailing list.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to the next decade! 🥂</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m catching up on MacStories&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;iPad at 10&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> coverage from last month.</p>
<p>I keep coming across mentions of the original argument that the iPad is &ldquo;just a bigger iPhone&rdquo;. I always find that argument to be so strange, because the iPhone was a blockbuster category-defining device. I have never thought of the fact that an iPad is similar to a large iPhone as negative in any way. I also appreciate viewpoints like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one focused on accessibility<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that make it obvious that being like a bigger iPhone is an incredible advantage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how aggressively people in the tech media will dismiss something just because it&rsquo;s not completely novel.</p>
<p>Anyway, 10 years later, I have finally gotten to the point where I don&rsquo;t own a laptop and use an iPad for all my mobile computing tasks.</p>

<p>My Sharp HDTV suffers from this greatly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s miserable waiting several seconds per channel while I try to hit &ldquo;channel up&rdquo; from a low number to a high number to catch a show that&rsquo;s about to start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also completely horrible to turn on the TV to a very loud station and have to wait several seconds before I can turn the volume down.</p>
<p>The firmware is upgradable, so I hope that Sharp somehow magically hears my plea for an upgraded experience.</p>

			 <p>In the last couple years, I have started reading several books, but finished very few. It would seem that my appetite for new knowledge doesn&rsquo;t have a very long attention span.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I spend night after night reading as much as I can from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feed reader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which right this instant clocks in at 501 subscriptions, with 1295 unread articles. I have yet to discover anyone who is subscribed to more feeds than I am.</p>
<p>Now I know that sounds staggering, and it should, but I don&rsquo;t read everything. Indeed, it would be pretty much impossible to do so. But I do make quite an effort, and in doing so I have initiated the reading of countless streams of never-ending text. Yet more books I will never finish.</p>
<p>One thing I did recently finish, in one sitting, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Patrick Combs&rsquo;s story from 1995<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about cashing a junk mail check for over $95,000. Not sure how long it would be as a book but it would certainly take more physical pages than the 10 or so webpages that the story is split into.</p>
<p>The other day at work I printed out a page of Google API documentation that I was reading, and it came out to about 36 pages. I had already pretty much read the whole thing by the time I hit &ldquo;Print&rdquo;, so I was taken aback a little bit at just how much I must read in any given day without skipping a beat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even starting to read books on my iPhone. Right now I&rsquo;m reading Edwin A. Abbott&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flatland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as part of the fun little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Classics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> application. So there&rsquo;s yet another incomplete reading.</p>
<p>So I guess the point is that I read a lot. My hunger for knowledge cannot be satiated.</p>
<p>So how do you occupy your time? Video games? Some sort of physical activity? Let me know in the comments.</p>

			 <p>A couple weeks ago I got the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logic Studio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Apple’s professional-level music writing software.</p>
<p>I upgraded from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logic Express 7<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which was almost three years old when I bought it. The polish was definitely lacking, and I got many headaches using it.</p>
<p>Before that I used an even older OEM version of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cubase LE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that came with my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PreSonus Firebox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The Firebox is an excellent piece of equipment but the old Cubase software is even more atrocious in this day and age. I got some good work done in it but it took a lot of work.</p>
<p>So, long story short, I’ve been training myself with the 73-page Getting Started manual for the last few weeks. After that I might delve into parts of the bundled 1000-page manual for Logic Pro 8 and the 660-page manual for its bundled software instruments and effects!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today I decided to try my hand at composing something real. I screwed around by layering a Bitcrusher distortion and a stereo Chorus on top of the “Hollow Pad” patch of the included ES E (Ensemble Synth) software instrument.</p>
<p>For drums I took one of the stock loops, Analog Drum Machine 52, and looped it under the stock Compressor with the “Toms Strong Compression” patch and under the SilverVerb reverb unit with the “Room” patch.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a bit repetitive but it took only about an hour to throw together. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Recently Austin (the person) and I have been playing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warning Forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an innovative freeware video game for Windows that had a small wave of interest a few years ago.</p>
<p>Warning Forever is a “Shoot ‘Em Up”, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shmup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which means you basically fly a ship around the screen and shoot at enemies. What makes Warning Forever different is that there are only boss enemies, one at a time.</p>
<p>On top of that, after beating one enemy, the next enemy evolves defenses based on the strategies you use. So if you find it easy to attack the front of the enemy for a quick kill, the next enemy will have a beefed-up front section. Thus you are encouraged to start with strategies that you are not good at in order to build up the enemy’s more useless defenses.</p>
<p>All in all, this game evokes many of the qualities I find important in a game: replayability, challenge, and direct feedback. Perhaps most importantly, the game takes a simple concept and lets it shine without muddying it up with over-designed details.</p>
<p>Give it a shot sometime.</p>

			 <p>While most of you were watching Super Bowl XLI, I went to my first breakdancing class. I&rsquo;m signed up to weekly classes at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dance Zone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through the UT Texas Union <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Informal Classes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> program.</p>
<p>The first class started with a brief discussion of the art and a passionate plea by our instructor to understand the history of what it&rsquo;s all about, which was refreshing since I worried it might turn out to be some lame hip hop dancing sort of class.</p>
<p>Nope, this is the real deal. My instructor has trained with the original B-Boys such as the ones featured in the classic movie <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Breakin'<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>There are about 10 beginners and 6 or 7 more advanced B-Boys and B-Girls in my class. The pace is pretty fast, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>On day one we started with a few basic moves to help us catch the beat, as classic original funk and breakbeat songs blasted on the hi-fi. The instructor then had us try to walk on our hands across the floor. I could do about 3 or 4 steps the few times I didn&rsquo;t immediately fall over.</p>
<p>After that we learned perhaps the most fundamental move of all, and the basis of &ldquo;footwork&rdquo;, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6-step<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s a pretty good YouTube video to show what I mean.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am still a bit sore from it, two days later, but that is subsiding now. I can&rsquo;t wait to get back in there!</p>

			 <p>I have been hired on as a UI Designer at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spiceworks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a startup company in Austin, Texas. This Thursday I’ll be driving down to start my apartment search, and I start work this Monday.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It should be a pretty good gig. They have just released the public beta version of their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free IT management application<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for small (~25 computer) networks. It’s all done in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rails<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but interestingly enough it runs on your local machine. This should open up some interesting UI possibilities given that client/server latency issues are greatly reduced.</p>
<p>I met several of my coworkers during interviews and I am looking forward to working with them and becoming their friend. Several of them are involved in local Rails groups and most if not all of them have been through multiple successful startups.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will be driving down on Thursday, and then aggressively searching for apartments over the weekend. If everything goes well I will be moved in by Sunday. Otherwise I will have to wing it somehow.</p>
<p>Before I head out I’m going up to my hometown of Enid, Oklahoma, to see my grandparents.</p>
<p>I don’t know anyone in the Austin area, so if you’re there and I didn’t realize it please drop me a line.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
That picture doesn&rsquo;t really do it justice.  Anyway, I sneaked
around as it was closing and as the band played &ldquo;Inagaddadavida&rdquo;. 
The Paseo is a small street off the beaten path in Oklahoma City where
a ton of artists live and have studios.  I saw a scultpor&rsquo;s
studio, photographer&rsquo;s studios, and a lot of closed Indian Taco stands.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Lately I haven&rsquo;t been up to too much.  The friends and I have
resolved to watch all of the Star Wars movies in order.  I&rsquo;m not
the hugest fan but it&rsquo;s a good source of trivia for who knows
when.  (Jeopardy!, here I come)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I hope that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my other blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
doesn&rsquo;t wither and die.  I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that I will
have enough sources of logical fallacies in news articles to make it
interesting.  I will keep looking though.  Feel free to
contact me if you find some.  I&rsquo;m trying to stick to reputable
sources.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My new phone has better text messaging and photo mail abilities, so
I&rsquo;ve been sending dog pictures out to Carrie and posting cameraphones
pictures on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Flickr site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  They are decidedly low quality but fun nonetheless.  One of these days I&rsquo;ll get my actual camera fixed.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Meredith&rsquo;s father brews beer (and wine, actually) at home.  He
keeps track of every batch in a notebook.  Right now he&rsquo;s working
on his 57th batch.  Seeing all of the handwriting made me wish I
had something to keep track of longterm like that.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, I am obsessed with typography these days.  This isn&rsquo;t just a passing thing, like my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cryptography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> phase or my oscillating interest with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thomas Pynchon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;m downright obsessed.  My two favorite fonts of the moment are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incognito<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dolly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, both available from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Veer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the design company famous (in my eyes) for employing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grant Hutchinson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Dolly is &ldquo;a book typeface with fluorishes&rdquo;.  I love book
typefaces, and every time I read a book I spend about as much time
admiring the letterforms as I do reading the actual content.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Incognito is based on the fancy writing of old maps.  When I was a
child I would peer into maps endlessly.  The best part about this
font is that each capital has a swash variant that goes in one of four
different directions, named after the Latin for North, East, South, and
West.  Very elegant, albeit a bit overused in their type specimens.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

I have no agenda other than the new blog&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;Question everything

The second hit I got was my recent mention in Prism, the American
Society for Engineering Education&rsquo;s monthly journal.  I highly

but I&rsquo;ve only received one actual offer, not really for a job but
instead for volunteer work to do a new PBS show&rsquo;s website.  I&rsquo;m
not really sure if doing that would be a horrible waste of my time or a

			 <p>Well it looks like you found this blog somehow.  Welcome!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My plan is to take everyday news articles and deconstruct them from a skeptical perspective. The general mission is “Question everything you read.” I will look at the way that reporters present messages in their writing and point out the questions I would ask the reporter if I was in a conversation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Posting will be irregular.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This page was inspired by recent discussions about my skepticism and by an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article I read in U.S. News and World Report<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about “prediagnosing” illnesses before they actually show up in a person.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Katherine Hobson starts:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->O<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ne fall day in 2003, more than 20 million Americans went to bed healthy and woke up sick. They didn&rsquo;t feel any different—no 24-hour stomach virus, no late-fall cold. What happened? An international committee published new guidelines for declaring someone “prediabetic”—that is, at increased risk of developing diabetes. Overnight, people who had never considered themselves sick were being told by their doctors that they had a medical problem. “Here are people who have been mostly doing what I asked—they&rsquo;ve been keeping their weight under control, exercising, and keeping their blood sugar levels constant, which is a good thing,” says Jenni Levy, a primary-care physician in Bethlehem, Pa. “But now I had to say that this is now abnormal. You have not changed, your blood sugar hasn&rsquo;t changed, but the rules have changed.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now when I read this, all I could think of was why don&rsquo;t they come out and say which international committee published these guidelines? Certainly doctors don&rsquo;t change their prognoses overnight. These messages take time to percolate through the diverse medical community, and I would imagine a great number of doctors would take such a study with a grain of salt.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Certainly the role of doctor involves giving the best care your patients could possibly get, but doctors make up a social group that involves a lot of give and take. One paper, regardless of the committee that publishes it, could never be expected to change the face of medicine and have the impact this opening paragraph might have you think.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there you have it.

			 <p>Ten years ago on this day I sat working on an assignment for my math
class.  I had tested out of a chapter of work and was working by
myself on a project to present to the class.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Sitting in the independent project classroom, we felt the building
shake.  At first the teacher told us it was probably a sonic
boom.  She used to live near an air force base, and recently on
the news people had talked about the possibility of stationing B2
stealth bombers at Tinker Air Force Base.  I thought it could have
been an earthquake.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We looked out the window and saw a plume of smoke, like a brush fire, about 10 miles away.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Around 9:00 am on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh drove a Ryder truck
full of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and nitromethane racing fuel in
front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma
City.  At 9:02 am the truck detonated, ultimately killing 168
people, from ATF agents to children in a daycare center.  At the
time it was by far the largest terrorist attack on American soil, and
to this day it remains the largest domestic terrorist attack.  The
death toll came out to approximately 13 times that of Columbine, the
school shooting that would take place exactly four years and one day
later.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Reports came back to school slowly.  We didn&rsquo;t really know what
was going on, but over time it became clear that it wasn&rsquo;t
normal.  Some students were told that their parents were OK. 
Something had happened downtown, and everyone was waiting on more
information.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My mom ran outside, thinking that a plane had exploded in the
air.  She had her window open and could hear the blast from 15
miles away.  She later went to the local Wal-Mart and saw a
photographer run in to get pictures developed.  They need to get
developed now!  They need to get to the media&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
That day was the first day my aunt was to do court reporting for a
federal trial, instead of the local and state trials she had been doing
before.  She sat in court in the Federal Courthouse, immediately
behind the Murrah building, certainly on the side one would rather be
on.  Her cassette tape recording of the trial caught the blare of
an enormous explosion, following by frantic voices and the judge
ordering everyone to immediately leave the building because a bomb had
gone off.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When I got home CNN was showing the same thing as the local news, and
every other channel for that matter.  Bulletins were put out for
&ldquo;middle eastern terrorists&rdquo; that never panned out.  A white
supremacist Gulf War veteran named Timothy McVeigh was arrested for
excessive speeding going north on I-35, away from the blast.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Once everyone figured out that it was a truck bomb, and the dust
settled, people began the rescue effort.  From all over the
country, and indeed the world, firefighters, police, medical personnel,
and volunteers poured in to help.  Some of these officials would
later die in the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center. 
Robots were used to dig through the rubble in the hopes of finding
survivors.  After a few days, these hopes were dashed and families
had to admit defeat.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
On Thursday, my parents took me and my brothers downtown to catch a
glimpse.  We weren&rsquo;t going to get close, just get within
eyeshot.  It was a media circus.  It seemed like every local
news station in America had a van parked there.  Police lines were
everywhere, blocking square miles of downtown.  Some extra line
was hanging off of a tree and I cut off a piece of it, which I have to
this day.  You could see the damage clearly from a mile
away.  The mood was somber and quiet and people were moving about
matter-of-factly.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A week later, once all hope was lost, and to further protect the
immediate area by preventing an imminent collapse, the Murrah buidling
was imploded and cleared away.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
April 19.  The date doesn&rsquo;t mean much outside of Oklahoma, but
there it automatically means the bombing.  A nameless federal
building housing seemingly unrelated federal offices that I had never
heard of was attacked by a man who wanted to avenge the botched siege
by federal agents of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, TX, two years
earlier.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
No one really knew why Oklahoma City should be a target.  Everyone
in the nation started talking about the &ldquo;heartland&rdquo;.  It was
&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->terror in the heartland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  Where you&rsquo;d least expect it.  The
governor of Oklahoma was on national television constantly, and each
day the police would report to the public the updated tally of those
who had died.  It ended at 168.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Months later, the State of Ohio donated some trees to plant at the
State Capitol, one each for the people who died.  I was a Boy
Scout, in Troop 78, and I volunteered that day.  I was up on stage
during the dedication holding the Oklahoma flag up so that it wouldn&rsquo;t
fall over in the wind.  That was the first and only time that I
heard the names of those killed read aloud.  It took about 45
minutes.  Many if not most of the survivors were there, as well as
families, planting trees for the people they knew and loved.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Just over six years later, terrorists attacked four planes, New York
City, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania.  Perhaps the worst part
about that day was knowing how it would play out, what the aftermath
would be.  First off, remember the date, September 11, we&rsquo;ll be
hearing about this for some time, just like April 19.  Second,
there will be a relief effort.  People will come from all over to
dig through the rubble in order to find survivors.  Third, the
time will come where no one could be expected to live under this
rubble.  People will still want to search, but they need to stop
sometime.  People will fight to keep looking, but realistically
it&rsquo;s already too late.  And there will be a few key images that
people remember.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For Oklahoma City, it is usually the firefighter holding the baby, who would die in the next day or so.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Ten years later, things are going a lot better in Oklahoma City. 
The other day we were featured on the front page of the B section of
the Wall Street Journal in a glowing article talking about the urban
development, increased tourism, and how well the city had moved past
the stigma of being a victim.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>My streak ended.  No, not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> streak.  Maybe later for that one.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But anyway I forgot to post last night.  Yesterday I went shopping
for some major school supplies, on the halfway day of the semester!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I also had my first 8 am class, which was wonderful!  I&rsquo;m so excited about complex numbers.  I simply adore them.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Anyway, I went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->special collections<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
at the library of Harvard&rsquo;s Graduate School of Design.  Before we
got into the library, we saw the best working environment I&rsquo;ve seen in
my life, a giant stairway of desks where people design
architecture.  Imagine a grand staircase of open cubicles, with
the newbies on the bottom and the PhD&rsquo;s on top.  After we went
into the library we saw a ton of stuff, such as hand-drawn plans for
the St. Louis Arch and Gropius&rsquo;s clipboard.  I held <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gropius<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s
clipboard.  I simply love clipboards!  I bought another one
at Staples today so that if I lose my current clippy I don&rsquo;t have to
fall behind in my classes!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And today I went to parties at Wellesley and briefly at Babson.  Had a lot of fun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

For my student government position I often administer surveys to
various groups of students.  The other day I made three different
mockups of a single survey I&rsquo;m about to give to the entire student
body.  I presented these mockups to my Human Factors: Interface
Design class to let the students test them out.  I learned quite a
lot from the process, and now I think the survey should be quite easy
to take (once I implement the best suggestions from the class).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

This monday, the Data Destruction Tour is coming to Boston.  The
Data Destruction Tour is the only tour I know of that specializes in
the tiny little subgenre of music known as lofi or 8bit or chiptunes or
gamemusic or about a million other things.  The idea is to use
1980s computer technology or video game systems or similar sounding
synthesis techniques to make music.  Hear some at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->micromusic.net<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. 
I have considered burning a few CDs of a some songs I have written in
this style and giving them around to the people involved to sorta jab
myself into the scene a bit.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>I wonder if it will be a snow day.  The weather is completely
horrible and miserable.  If it&rsquo;s a snow day, it will have no
impact on me, however, because I have no classes on Wednesday.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A snow day on any other day would help me catch up so much, but a Wednesday snow day does nothing for me.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I say &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not too far behind on things.  I
certainly have a lot going on, but when I sit down and think about it,
they are moving along fine.  Some of my things could use some more
enthusiasm, and the occasional jolt back into action, but really I am
on top of most stuff right now.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We made a transistor radio in Analog and Digital Communications,
hard-tuned to WEEI 850 AM sports radio.  The class is really
starting to make a lot more sense these days.  It only makes me
wish I could spend more time designing circuits or software for
processing audio.  Designing audio filters, in hardware or in
software, is one of my favorite activities.  Luckily, I&rsquo;m majoring
in the right thing, Electrical and Computer Engineering.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Wow, thanks Dan.  Really classy.  That wasn&rsquo;t what I

I came up with a new way to make my todo list.  I put todo items
up on Post-It notes on my wall.  The higher notes represent more
important things I need to do, like get a job for summer.  The
bottom notes are not important, such as fixing my digital camera. 
That way I still see everything I have to do, but I don&rsquo;t forget the
important stuff.  I&rsquo;ll tell you how it goes.  I think this
will finally be the method I keep.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today I stopped doing things for an hour.  It was splendid. 
Since last Thursday, I hadn&rsquo;t stopped for even ten minutes. 
Constant activity, moving from class to party to class to meeting to
meeting to the candidate&rsquo;s weekend and back again.  Finally I can
get some sleep.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Starting this Friday I will have an 8 am class, Complex
Variables.  I&rsquo;m actually really excited about Complex
Variables.  They really come in handy for messing with audio
signals.  But anyway this means that my first classes each day
will look like this:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Monday 2 PM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Tuesday 8 AM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Wednesday (no class, nothing until CORe meeting at 6:30 PM)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Thursday 2 PM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Friday 8 AM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It doesn&rsquo;t get any weirder than that.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, elections are going to be soon for CORe (The Council of Olin
Representatives), so I will sadly give up my post as Vice Presdient of
Communication.  I might run for another executive position, but I
haven&rsquo;t decided yet.  The CORe Digest is my baby!  I will
miss it!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Yesterday my professor didn&rsquo;t show up for my class
Synchronization.  There are 6 students in the class, but only 5
showed up.  We waited for a bit and then one of the staff came in
and told us the professor wasn&rsquo;t coming.  We then spent the entire
remainder of the class period going over the homework, writing stuff up
on the board, and debating it.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>Back to blogging!  A lot of people are getting involved on the Olin College blogring these days.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We just had the first Candidate&rsquo;s Weekend of the year.  It went
very well.  The students are getting inspired again to be at Olin.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today I put a bunch of pictures up on flickr.  Just go to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy">http://www.flickr.com/photos/nertzy</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today the rest of the CORe E-Board and I went to the senior
administration meeting for Olin.  We gave student feedback to the
President, VPs, and heads of various departments.  I think it went
well.  I got to learn a lot of details about running a new school.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I got my camera back today in the mail.  I&rsquo;d left it in Drew&rsquo;s car
in LA.  It reminds me of all my broken items.  My camera&rsquo;s
flash doesn&rsquo;t work.  My palm&rsquo;s screen doesn&rsquo;t work.  My next
palm&rsquo;s screen cracked.  The face broke off of my nice watch. 
If only I weren&rsquo;t so lazy I would fix them all.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Now all I really need is a summer job.  A nice internship.  I
have some wonderful contacts lined up so I guess I should start asking
them for advice.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The new Chemical Brothers album, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Push the Button<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is
very nice.  I like the first two tracks best, &ldquo;Galvanize&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Boxer&rdquo;.  I didn&rsquo;t like &ldquo;Galvanize&rdquo; the first time I heard it, or
even the second, but now it&rsquo;s one of my all-time favorite Chemical
Brothers songs.  It&rsquo;s interesting to note that I also didn&rsquo;t like
&ldquo;Block Rockin' Beats&rdquo; the first few times I heard it.  I still
haven&rsquo;t figured out how the Chemical Brothers are able to evoke this
initial disinterest.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;m about to embark tomorrow morning on a grand trip from Oklahoma City
to Los Angeles, for 22 hours.  I&rsquo;m going with Drew, who lives out
there with my friend Jon.  I will be flying back to Oklahoma City
on the 18th.  I hope to bump into as many people in LA as I
can.  I went last year but only knew three people from LA. 
This year I know at least ten.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Other than that I&rsquo;ve been reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->V.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Thomas Pynchon.  I&rsquo;ve finished <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crying of Lot 49<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
and will then move on to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mason &amp; Dixon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before tackling the
grand-daddy Pynchon book of all time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Wish me
luck, this is not an easy task.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

Austin and I continue our work on Gamecube games.  I have ordered
the hardware that will allow me to load my code from an SD card, so
everyone at Olin will finally get to see Snowlords in action!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

Other than that I applied to some jobs at The MathWorks and
Apple.  I will apply to some less ambitious places too so that I
don&rsquo;t yet again come up empty-handed.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>Hello everyone.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So it&rsquo;s been awhile since my last update.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
No photos today.  I&rsquo;ve taken a lot in these last ten days or so, but those will come later.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;m back home in Oklahoma now.  Nothing much going on here. 
In fact, I&rsquo;ve seen much fewer people than I usually would have since
I&rsquo;ve gotten back.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Last weekend I stayed with my roommate Dan at his house in Somerville,
Massachusetts.  On the days while everyone was working at their
internships, I wandered down Highland Ave. near Davis Square and
snapped a ton of pictures of typical Americana.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
While in the Boston area, Dan, Tommy, and I went to the Skellig bar in
Waltham and competed in the trivia contest.  We started strong,
but ended with a fairly miserable showing, coming in dead last. 
One round left us with zero points earned.  Unfortunately we will
be unable to show them what we really are capable of because Dan and I
will have a Mathematical Analysis class in which we will prove the
calculus from scratch on Mondays from 9:30 to 11:30 pm this
semester.  What better way to pass the time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I started and finished Fermat&rsquo;s Enigma, a book on solving the most
famous mathematical problem of the last few centuries, Fermat&rsquo;s Last
Theorem.  Since then I&rsquo;ve completed the first four chapters of the
9/11 Commission Report.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The last few nights have seen countless hours spent on trying to get
multiplayer Red Alert, Red Alert 2, Quake II, Quake III, or Warcraft
III working properly.  Our best successes have been
cross-platform, ironically.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I will take a picture of my family&rsquo;s new poker chips for the next post.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Last Wednesday Cagle and her friend Erin came from Alabama to visit for three days.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We wandered around the Big Apple and hit a lot of cool shops in
Greenwich Village, where I snagged some good vinyl and a really cheap 
hardcover
copy of Thomas Pynchon&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mason and Dixon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to add to my to-read list.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I found this picture on the wall at Famiglia&rsquo;s Pizza, a nice New York pizza joint.  My brother will appreciate it.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Tucker, Cagle, Erin, and I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jacques Torres&rsquo;s chocolatier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Brooklyn for my third time.  I found these chocolate sculptures in the back room:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We walked back over the Brooklyn Bridge, for my fourth time.  I
found this spray-painted into the concrete of the bridge walkway. 
I hate it when people spray paint messages on stuff using
stencils.  It&rsquo;s tacky and rude, but at least in this particular
case it supports my political cause, albeit to an extreme.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We ran into a b-boy posse breakdancing for the crowd later that day.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The next day we ran into a large group of firefighters and police
unexplainedly axing their way into a Borders bookstore which otherwise
seemed fine.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We ate at a nice little Greek restaurant in the Village, and I ordered
pastichio, a traditional Greek dish that my mother and grandmother make
every once in a while since my grandfather has full Greek blood. 
The pastichio was excellent, the salad was wonderful in its feta glory,
and the baklava was just what I like, proving that I do indeed have
Greek blood running in my veins.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
On Saturday after the two girls left Tucker, Mara, and I went kayaking
in the Hudson River.  If you go to the end of Riverside Park by
72nd Street, they have a little platform set up where you can hop on a
kayak for free for up to 20 minutes, or up to 2 hours on Fridays.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The journey offered a wonderful view of Manhattan, dominated in this particular area by a series of Trump condominium buildings.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Dan drove down from Boston later that day and stayed the night. 
We ran around town some more and ended up in Hoboken, NJ, for my final
trip to visit Emily at Stevens.  Dan grabbed some of my belongings
to help me in my upcoming move to Boston for the weekend before my
flight home next Wednesday.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
On the way back from work on Monday, Tucker and I ran into a strange sight:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Sorry for the gruesome imagery, but whatever got to this bird left the
wings and only the wings entirely intact.  Very strange.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today Tucker, Mara, and I ate at an Afghanistan restaurant.  I
loved it!  I didn&rsquo;t expect to, since I had nothing to base
expectations on.  I am now convinced that orange rind should be
put into every dish.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After putting in a little more work on the synth, Mara and I watched a
bootleg copy of Fahrenheit 9/11, which I found to be suprisingly devoid
of any real argument or fresh, important details about its title
disaster.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I highly recommend the 9/11 Commission Report for anyone who wants a
serious look into the reality of the situation.  You can grab a
recording of an executive summary free on iTunes right now.  I
much prefer to read it, however, and want to buy a copy sometime
soon.  It&rsquo;s now on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon wish list<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Go be curious and poke around on it if you like.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>My luck continues to rise.  When I walked home from work today I
found a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer with 61-key keyboard lying against a
trash can to be thrown out.  I snagged it and left a note behind
in case the person didn&rsquo;t mean to throw it out.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
However, the state of the keyboard suggests it was ready to be thrown out.  For example, the power cable has come loose.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am an electrical engineer, so this does not faze me in the
slightest.  Soon I will grab a soldering iron and make it work to
the best of my abilities.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The Yamaha DX7 was a popular synthesizer of the 1980s, and make a lot
of the defining sounds of eighties music.  Its quality isn&rsquo;t
wonderful, from what I&rsquo;ve heard, but it&rsquo;s a synthesizer nonetheless and
I&rsquo;m sure I can find good uses for it, especially as a keyboard
controller for my computer music setup.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After I had spent hours waiting in the rain to get tickets to the
Shakespeare in the Park show in Central Park, and after the rain fully
cleared up, they cancelled the show.  However, before I got in
line for standby tickets, I did manage to snap some pictures of a
completely burnt car on the side of the road.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The flames completely destroyed the interior, leaving a metallic shell.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today I ate dinner outside on patio seating at Max SoHa, a most
wonderful Italian restaurant less than a block from my apartment.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The food is excellent and the atmosphere very comfortable and familial.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;SoHa&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;South of Harlem,&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ve similary named our startup synthesizer software company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SoHa Sound Design<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,
in reference to where the development actually took place.  We&rsquo;re
hoping to finish up a release candidate of the final synthesizer by the
time I leave New York on August 11, and have a final 1.0 version ready
for sale a few weeks thereafter.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Cagle and her friend come up to visit me for a few days on Wednesday
and Dan comes up on Saturday, so my week should be filled with plenty
of excitement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Today I received a postcard from the daily version of Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire.  They accepted me into the contestant pool and more
likely than not they will call me in the next month or two and give me
a tape date.  The daily version has no Fastest Finger, so if I got
on I would be directly in the Hot Seat.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The synth project goes well.  We should have a final product ready
in a week or two.  The last few days have been slow, but today
something clicked and both Tucker and I made incredibly impressive
progress.  The sound quality has increased tremendously and our
product has a lot of potential, in my humble opinion.  OK, maybe
it&rsquo;s not as humble as possible.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The other day the entire ISE office went to Mama Mexico, a fairly good Mexican restaurant:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My boss Chris is on the left.  He&rsquo;s gotten me hooked on the egg
and cheese sandwiches with Tabasco sauce that they sell on the street
corner by our office.  It tastes better than it probably sounds.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Lately, some of the workers in the office have been clearing out old
equipment and files to put in the dumpsters.  I snapped a quick
pic of some vacuum tubes in one particularly old piece of equipment:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The next book on my reading agenda is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mind at Light Speed: A New Kind of Intelligence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
by David D. Nolte.  Every book I&rsquo;ve read this summer has tied into
cognition, how the senses work, or quantum theory.  This book
manages to tie all three concepts together and draw even more links
between the variety of new things I&rsquo;ve learned about in prior
books.  I&rsquo;m surprised how in what I thought was a seemingly random
assortment of books I have happened onto the same major concepts three
or four times now.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I have now covered the paranoid angle, the medical angle, the artistic
angle, and finally the scientific angle of such things as neural
theory, quantum physics, and how we perceive images.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I spent Monday in Hoboken, NJ, with my old friend Emily.  She&rsquo;s a
photographer so as soon as I got there we went to a shoot she had been
hired for.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
She captured the essence of a Wall Street entrepreneur&rsquo;s million dollar
apartment.  I chatted him up on wine and travel and he predicts
that Argentina will be the next great wine producer in the next decade
or so.  I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Afterwards, we went to the Stevens Institute of Technology bowling
alley, and I rolled a series of three bowling games.  Although I
threw some great balls, I tended to step over the foul line and this
particular alley made sure not to count two of my strikes and one seven
pin frame, so I didn&rsquo;t even break 100 on my first game.  I plan on
going bowling more this school year.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Tomorrow will be Shakespeare in the Park in Central Park (if we can get
tickets this time) and Saturday will be my second short story event at
Columbia.  The short story events involve a bunch of people (who I
met through Tucker) collecting together and reading aloud their
favorite short stories.  It&rsquo;s simple, envigorating, and human to
listen to others tell stories.  Lately, attendees have been
encouraged to write their own short stories to tell at the next
session.  I might attempt to bring this concept to Olin.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Today when my friend Mara came to my room I started blabbing about a

it though and manically spoke back so I guess it was fine.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>Hello everyone.  I have several important Grant updates for the last couple days.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Last Tuesday, July 13, 2004, I went to the free Fountains of Wayne
concert at the World Financial Center downtown.  The World
Financial Center is right across the street from the World Trade Center
site.  I snapped this pic of the new WTC station that opened up
earlier this year:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Anyway I made my way to the back side of the big huge indoor Winter
Garden at the WFC, where all sorts of people started crowding around
the stage outside.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
They played a good set and poked a little fun.  At one point, the
lead singer changed around some lyrics to Radiation Vibe for old
diehard fans like me to pick up, since parents and kids made up the
majority of the audience due to the newfound recent success of their
latest album.  They came out for a double encore, which now marks
the second time I&rsquo;ve seen them do a double encore, although both times
it seemed like they weren&rsquo;t planning to.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t hear &ldquo;The Biker Song&rdquo; this time, but they
finally played it in the double encore, so this concert marks the first
time in a while that the band played every song I wanted to hear. 
Hmm, well all except &ldquo;Troubled Times&rdquo; I guess.  The band hails
from New Jersey, and many of their songs deal with places in New Jersey
or New York City, which made the show even better.  My favorite
song by them right now, &ldquo;Sick Day&rdquo;, takes place on a PATH train from
New Jersey, so after the show I got them to sign my PATH Quick Card,
although they seemed confused at first as to the reference.  On
top of that they seemed a little drunk and partially deaf,
unfortunately.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The lead singer, Chris Collingwood said that he used to work in this building on the 35th floor (he&rsquo;s the one on the right):<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
On Thursday I again tried out for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, the
daily version.  This time I passed the test and got to the
interview process.  They took a Polaroid of me and the interviewer
seemed pretty interested in several things that I had to say, so in
three or four weeks I will know if I am eligible to be on the show.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After that, I met up with Leighton and we went to the lounge of the new
Mandarin Oriental hotel up on the 35th floor.  Here was our view
of Central Park:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After that we had lunch at a wonderful restaurant called Eatery with
prices much lower than the quality of the food.  After that we
went hotel lobby hopping and ended up at a really posh lobby at W Hotel
in Times Square and the incredible world&rsquo;s largest lobby at the New
York Marriott Marquis:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Yes, this picture was taken indoors.  To give a little
perspective, those are balconies off of each floor which face down into
the atrium.  Leighton took a business call, and I relaxed and
almost fell asleep:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After that I returned to the apartment and fell asleep for six
hours.  I have ruined my daily schedule entirely, so now I&rsquo;m going
to go program some more for the software project Tucker and I work on
all the time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Ciao.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Saturday the fabled trip to Staten Island finally took place.  We
hopped on the red line subway and transferred to the Staten Island
Ferry, a big free boat.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Standing at the extreme front of the ship offered this view:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I have now seen both Statues of Liberty.  After the French donated the statue, they erected a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->smaller copy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Paris, which I saw by chance out of the side of a train car during my trip there two years ago.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Upon arriving on Staten Island, we proceeded to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Chinese
Scholar&rsquo;s Garden<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
at the Staten Island Botanical Garden.  For everyone less familiar
with New York City, Staten Island makes up a large portion of New York
City, and is one of the five boroughs along with Manhattan, Queens, the
Bronx, and Brooklyn.  Staten Island is mostly surburban as opposed
to the other boroughs, featuring malls instead of skyscrapers.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
However, the Chinese Scholars Garden, the first of its kind in the
United States, offered an escape from the trappings of city life:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
OK, this first picture wasn&rsquo;t from the Chinese Scholar Garden per se,
but instead from a smaller garden within the botanical garden.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This mosaic was made by a traditional Chinese scholar garden artist who
uses materials around him.  The white parts were rice bowls he
broke from the kitchen without asking and the green parts are Heineken
bottles.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We continued to a blatant &ldquo;secret&rdquo; garden, which was closed. 
Since we had paid for admission, we felt it acceptable to hop onto the
wall and sit for awhile.  As the photographer, I do not appear in
these photos.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Afterwards Tucker impressively hopped onto a nearby and somewhat inaccessible tree:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We ended the day by watching King Arthur, which not unlike Lord of the
Rings did not strike my fancy.  I did manage to stay awake for
this one, fighting hard at times.  I did enjoy the show for what
it was, but I could not suspend disbelief long enough to really care
about what was going on.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today at work during my lunch break a bird flew over and perched on my outside table in the rain:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
He rejected my offer of a small morsel of tomato (the red spot in the
picture), but violently grabbed Tucker&rsquo;s offering of a little piece of
bread and cheese and flew away fast enough that he could be sure we
couldn&rsquo;t reconsider.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

She&rsquo;s a beauty.  The kitchen has returned to normal, except that
now the gas range and stove do not light themselves.  Therefore,
we our celebratory tuna sandwiches went uncooked.  However, all
was not lost.  I discovered the new entry to our kitchen today, a
mirror nailed to a cabinet door:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->

the street than I could ever hope for, a commonplace occurrence in a big
city such as this one.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today I finished a book I had borrowed from Tucker called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Evolution of Useful Things: How everyday artifacts—from forks and pins to paper clips and zippers—came to be as they are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;ve finished two books so far this summer.  The first was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crying of Lot 49<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
by Thomas Pynchon, which I found very captivating, despite its immensely
obscure references and themes.  One of my life goals is to finish
Pynchon&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,
a most dense and unfriendly book which introduces ridiculous characters
nonstop and shoots around from the history of plastic to political
theory to differential equations to German folk songs often within one
sentence.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But for now, the next book on my list is the Olin College summer reading, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phantoms in the Brain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,
by V.S. Ramachandran, M.D., Ph.D. and Sandra Blakeslee, a book
concerning cognitive syndromes and how they reveal insights into our
own mental functions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Hello everyone.  Time for the daily kitchen ceiling update. 
My cell phone alarm did not go off because I had it set to &ldquo;Ringer

that I was fifteen minutes late to work today, allowing me to witness

			 <p>Hello everyone and welcome to New York City.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;re on 123rd Street between Amsterdam and Broadway:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You approach 522 W 123rd St., affectionately known as &ldquo;The Lorraine&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Why it&rsquo;s named The Lorraine I will never know.  No other building
anywhere near has a name.  After going up a couple flights of
stairs you find yourself in Apt. 3W and enter.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You stop by the kitchen:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You look up at the ceiling:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You notice that something doesn&rsquo;t look right, and it&rsquo;s not just that
the light fixture is an uncovered power-saving fluorescent bulb that is
connected by thinly insulated wires which go right behind the
electrical sockets and are held to the side of the wall by metal screws
through the insulation which are painted white.  Those bulbs are
in the other rooms.  The kitchen has a problem all its own.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>This morning I was awakened by two Chinese men asking me if I had a
&ldquo;twisted pair wire cutter thing&rdquo;, which meant an ethernet cable
crimper.  One was the landlord and the other was the father of the
two high school kids who will be moving into our apartment.  We
networked the entire house today.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After that, Tucker baked some cookies using his old recipe from his mother.  We noticed a large bulge in the ceiling.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Looks like a leak from the floor above somehow.  Our apartment
used to be three bedrooms, but two of the bedrooms were split with
cheap fake walls, which were put right on top of the carpet. 
Tucker slid a wire under the wall between our rooms when we wired the
house up.  It&rsquo;s nice to know that we can slide things to each
other under the wall at any time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I had a great Fourth of July!  I tagged along with Tucker and his
friends and went to DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge) to watch
purportedly the largest fireworks show in the nation.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You can see the Brooklyn Bridge right in front of the fireworks, which
were a couple miles from us just south of the tip of Manhattan.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We were on some rocks right next to the Brooklyn-side pylon of the
Manhattan Bridge:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The skyline looked like this:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

Today I downloaded Fahrenheit 9/11 after I read that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Michael Moore
doesn&rsquo;t care if people pirate his movie<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I will watch it soon,
probably with my friend Mara from downstairs.  I previewed the
first few minutes and found a lot of hype without a lot of argument, as
I expected.  You can download <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fahrenheit 9/11<!-- raw HTML omitted --> too, while supplies last. (UPDATE: you will need <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BitTorrent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in order to download it, and this version is missing about 20 minutes concerning the Patriot Act)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The only things I ate today were several of Tucker&rsquo;s cookies and a bowl of Chilled Gazpacho soup from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Josie&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Tomorrow might be another Taco Bell day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Hello again everyone.  I have just returned from Spiderman 2, and
I loved it.  I am a big sucker for comic book movies.  I read
a review today on Yahoo! Movies:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In a time when losers decide to profit off dead Americans and reek
propaganda unseen since the fall of the Soviets, comes a movie worth
every penny! A movie that assumes that we&rsquo;re not all brainless idiots!
However, just people looking for a solid sense of entertainment in
contrary to hidden issues masking political bloopers, infamous
outtakes, and puppetry of audience perception.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->So
as all of my more liberal friends groan, I want to touch on why I love
the concept of comic books and superheroes.  I feel that the
classic characters, from Spiderman to Batman and everywhere in between,
represent a lot of what goes on in American life.  Watching Peter
Parker not meet rent while I&rsquo;m paying rent for the first time, and
seeing him go around New York, my current home, and Columbia
University, my current employer, bring reality into such a fake movie.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And one of the classic Spiderman messages is so uplifting in my
opinion.  It&rsquo;s not that doing the right thing will get you
ahead.  It&rsquo;s not that being a superhero will make everyone love
you, or even give you self-confidence.  The main message I heard
from the movie is to work, work, work.  When you know what you&rsquo;re
doing is the right thing, work at it.  When you&rsquo;re not sure, keep
on working.  Just get through it all and leave it better than you
found it.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
One of my favorite songs is The Noise of Carpet by Stereolab. 
This song rocks way more than the remainder of their often-mellow,
always obscure fare.  Somehow I love the mix of the unabashed guitar-driven music and the deadpanned yet quite firm lyrics:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I told myself I would never stoop to such a level as having a website I didn&rsquo;t code myself.  But then I succumbed.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Dan told me that in order to have a good blog I can&rsquo;t just talk about
what I&rsquo;ve been up to.  I need to talk about the ideas I&rsquo;m having
and try to make my blog something worth reading.  Challenge
accepted.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My first big idea:  I&rsquo;ve tried to eliminate my usage of
exclamation points recently.  I realized that if what I&rsquo;m saying
needs an exclamation point in order to get its point across, I haven&rsquo;t
written it effectively.  I often catch myself putting exclamation
points on every other sentence of emails I write, especially the CORe
Digest.  I might leave them in for the CORe Digest since I&rsquo;m not
exactly going to take the trouble to strip them out by hand from what
people send me.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If you&rsquo;re not from Olin you probably don&rsquo;t care one bit about the CORe
Digest.  For the curious, I put out a weekly email newsletter to
the campus as part of my role on the student government.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I stayed home all day today. My aunt and uncle and two cousins came over. We ate barbecue then played a lot of ping pong. Today my dad invited me to come along with him to go see the U.S. Open in Tulsa this Tuesday. I was very excited, until I found out it was the golf U.S. Open and not the tennis one. Oh well. Tennis and golf are the only sports I can stand to watch on television, but I don&rsquo;t think I could watch golf live without going crazy. We also watched the NBA Finals Game 3. We made fun of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shaq<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and his rap career and the Shaq Fu video game. We also watched Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and the timeless favorite cable auction. After the relatives left, I retired to my room and downloaded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Hat Linux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which took a very long time. This day was a little more laid back and relaxing than the rest. So there.</p>

			 <p>Today I went to the Omniplex with Veronica, Jason, and Leigh Ann. My favorite part was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->International Photography Hall Of Fame<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I find it strange that it&rsquo;s at the Omniplex, but it has some really cool prints and some old cameras. We also rode the Geovator and did a lot of the now silly-seeming experiments. Man, I used to so love them! Afterwards we ate at the Macaroni Grill, where there are people singing opera quite often. I ordered Insalata Con Pollo. Very good. We then ventured onward to the Paseo. There wasn&rsquo;t anything going on there at all, so we ventured to 23rd and found out Vintage Plus and Rainbow Records were closed. We then hit CD Outlet where we met Jon and Alexandra (his girlfriend). I spent 10 dollars buying 4 oldskool rave CDs, including two by Quadrophonia, which includes one of the members of T-99. Wow. That&rsquo;s fun. Then we went to Jon&rsquo;s and watched a pirated Freddy Got Fingered bootleg video CD on his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sega Dreamcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The first Video CD ended, but the second one wouldn&rsquo;t play, so we watched cable auction instead. The knife table really sucked. They had this Confederate knife that we all didn&rsquo;t think was very cool. Then Veronica, Jason, and Leigh Ann headed home, and so did I. When I got home I played my brother some Street Fighter Alpha 2 emulated on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAME<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Then I went downstairs and wrote out a week&rsquo;s worth of News page entries with the recently regained Internet connection. Another full day of fun. Life is good.</p>

			 <p>Woke up when Jon complained loudly to Jesse not to make meow noises and wake him up. Perhaps I should have told Jon not to make loud complaining noises so as to not wake <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> up. I went home that morning and looked at the new 1 GHz <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Compaq<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we bought cheap from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->overstock.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It needed a network card, so we bought one at the wondeful CompUSA. Stephanie called and invited us to Eischen&rsquo;s, a supposedly-really-good chicken joint in Okarche. I was all for it, and eventually Jon, Austin, and I set out. But then Jon got kinda mad when we were following Stephanie&rsquo;s other friends on the way there and decided to ditch them. We drove by a cool abandoned farm instead. We decided to eat at Del Rancho&rsquo;s, of all places. I called Veronica and she and Jason came up to visit us. We watched some cable auction. We then ventured to the abandoned farm again. After that we hit Taco Cabana and went to Jon&rsquo;s, and they left. I decided to go home as well at this time. Another fun day with Veronica and Jason. Veronica then invited us all to the Omniplex for tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>This was a very fun day. Jon asked me to visit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Norman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with him. We went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OU<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to look at their film program. It wasn&rsquo;t so impressive. Jon is strongly considering OCCC instead, which has a nice new video production program with updated technology. Nate helps out with it too. Then I called Sheeva when we were done so we could hang out like I told her we would sometime. She wasn&rsquo;t there so I called Veronica. She was at OU! We met up with her, her twin sister Erica, and friends Jason and Leigh Ann at the Union building. We watched Jason eat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chick-Fil-A<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Then we stopped by Sonic to redeem some Sonic dollars, since Jon has about ten million sitting around he got as a graduation present. Then we went to &ldquo;the park.&rdquo; Jason helped designed some of the kids' playground equipment areas and he showed us his input. We swang on the swings and Veronica discovered that her older sister Amy got into a wreck. This is a recurring theme, as Erica wrecked a couple days earlier. Let&rsquo;s all hope the trend doesn&rsquo;t continue in the Edwards family. We then went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Borders<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where Josh and Sheeva write their haikus. We rummaged around there for awhile, then spent too long in the parking lot plotting our next move. We went back to Sonic to spend more Sonic dollars, then back to the park, it now being night. We just sat around in the park until about 12:00 and then came home. It may not sound like much but this was one of the funnest days I&rsquo;ve had in a while. At Jon&rsquo;s house, Jesse had brought over his brand-new refurbished used iMac. It is very cool. We got it to say what people IMed us out loud, which entertained Jon and me until 5 in the morning. Thence we partook in sleep.</p>

			 <p>Today I went to the orthodontist. I checked out OK. Then he took an x-ray of my wisdom teeth to help in removing them. Little did I know (OK, I did know, but I forgot) that I already had one done at the dentist over Spring Break, and that I don&rsquo;t need them out, at least yet. I hope never to get them out. This is one thing that really bothers me. I know I will evenutally give in, however, no harm done. Afterwards I got an oil change, or as I told Jon and Austin, a &ldquo;lube job&rdquo;. They gave me funny looks. We then went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CompUSA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best Buy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Macs are very cool all of a sudden. They are good for digital video editing, which is why Jon and Jesse both are getting them. We also stopped by Guitar Center and played with synths and drum machines like we always do. Then I got a lime slush and Sonic and went home.</p>

			 <p>I woke up much earlier than usual, 10:30 AM. Yeah, I know, poor me. Little did I realize I was running late for my doctor&rsquo;s appointment at 11:00. I got there in time, however. I checked out fine in my college physical. I guess Olin can let me come now. I need to get my Hepatitis B shots still. They gave me a tourniquet and drew blood. How fun! Afterwards Mother and I picked up Kyle from Driver Ed. He then drove us to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taco Bell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and we made him order drive-thru. I got the Nachos BellGrande. Good eatin'. A little later, my good buddy Nate asked if I&rsquo;d help network the computers he uses with Lifetime Video Productions, his other job besides running his own production outfit. We bought a couple of wires and meanwhile tried to think of a good new name for Real Life Productions, since we might change the name and web address. Nothing conclusive. At home, we didn&rsquo;t have Internet access, for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@Home<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hadn&rsquo;t updated our connection for our brand new cable modem yet. Instead we had to do real family-type things such as play the board game Omega Virus, which is very fun. After that I went to eat at IHOP with Kamaria and Josh and Josh&rsquo;s Kelsey. Too many people have the same name, and I always find it funny when they become &ldquo;owned&rdquo; like that for clarity.</p>

			 <p>Discovered that there isn&rsquo;t much to do on a Monday in Oklahoma City.

Afterwards we went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chili&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to eat. We then commenced in aimlessly driving around noticing that there is little to do on a Monday.

			 <p>Today I went to Jesse&rsquo;s again, to see A@ron&rsquo;s play he put on at Occidental. It was (and still is, I guess) entitled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;America and Masturbation: A Play About Sex&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was somewhat awkward watching it with such people as Jesse&rsquo;s parents and his grandmother, but it was fun nonetheless. Jesse&rsquo;s grandmother is a psychologist, and has been practicing for well over 60 years now, which I find amazing. After the show I hung out with Jesse and we went with his father, grandmother, and A@ron to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Souper! Salad!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I had never eaten at one before. They are very wonderful. You can get so much food for not very many moneys (inside cable auction joke). The only thing that surprised me was that they had much fewer soup options than they did salad ones. We then high-tailed it over to Jon&rsquo;s. Jesse and I performed an experiment. We both left at the same time from his house and took two different routes to get to Jon&rsquo;s. I took May, he took the Hefner Parkway. We tied. It didn&rsquo;t really help Jesse out like he had hoped. Tough luck. Then Jesse, Austin, Jon and I did something that I am sure will shock you all. We ate at the Edmond Whataburger. Yes, yet another Whataburger. What can I say? It&rsquo;s a great place. Then I went home to sleep, as usual.</p>

			 <p>Where to begin&hellip;? I woke up this morning when my aunts came over, with my little cousin Shayla. She&rsquo;s the coolest. She&rsquo;s only about 2 I think and she told me when I was banging the drums to &ldquo;stop making so many noises.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a little smartie! After that I headed over to Jesse&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s residence, where I watched Jesse&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s videos. A@ron does sketch comedy in a troupe at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Occidental College<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the &ldquo;Sketchy People.&rdquo; We then went to Jesse&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s residence to see what A@ron got Jesse for his graduation. It was a toilet. A@ron filmed Jesse and me as we sprayed it with a hose. For about 45 minutes. We also pretended like sticks were our arms and beat the toilet with them. And then this kid walked up with a Super Soaker, so Jesse made him squirt the toilet in the front yard. Oh yeah, and it was filled with red paint. After that we went to Casady&rsquo;s graduation. They have bagpipes instead of Pomp and Circumstance and a &ldquo;Senior speaker&rdquo; instead of a Valedictorian. At the fun reception thing afterwards, this girl came up to me. I remembered her from the Casady last-day-of-school party in which we had our picture taken for some reason. She told me that it was developed and came out well and then told me she&rsquo;d mail it to me and walked off. I don&rsquo;t know how she knows where I live, and I thought she didn&rsquo;t even have my last name. Creepy. After graduation, I went to Aimee&rsquo;s house. For those of you who are less informed, Aimee is the friend of Jackie, who is Jesse&rsquo;s girlfriend. I&rsquo;ve never really hung out with them before, and we had fun. We went to the coffeehouse by Galileo&rsquo;s and played 20 questions. The things we had to guess: Dennis Rodman, herniated disc, space shuttle Challenger, and big turtle. Stephanie came with her friend Cole and hung out for a little while. Then we went back to Aimee&rsquo;s and watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Way of the Gun<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is too complicated for my tastes. I then went home at 2:30am and ate my first food of the day except for a couple pieces of pizza. Ay caramba!</p>

			 <p>Spent the night at Jon&rsquo;s, woke up around 12:30. Then we wrote a song. It was OK, but too &ldquo;busy.&rdquo; Lots of drum parts. Maybe I&rsquo;ll filter it out later. Maybe not. Then I went home and downloaded a lot of games for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAME<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator). Wes invited me to see The Animal with him and some people, and I was going to go, but I took too long getting ready and missed it. So I stayed home. I ripped out the ol' Sega Genesis for some old school gaming action, but then Jon came over and we wrote some more songs. I wrote a really cool one by myself while Jon was here, too. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put it up here to listen to. It&rsquo;s more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experimental<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

Then we watched Traffic. Very good movie. Jon fell asleep so he missed out. We also stole Alexandra&rsquo;s guitar from her (with her permission) so Jon and I could write some music.

			 <p>Josh called me at 8:30 or something. I forgot to call back. He called me about an hour after I went to sleep. And Erin woke up four and a half hours before I went to sleep. How odd. Brian, Kamaria, Erin, and I hung out today. We went to Arby&rsquo;s, McDonald&rsquo;s, Wherehouse Music (on May), Sonic, and Barnes and Noble. Yes, three restaurants. I got a 42 cent 42 ounce drink, then spilled it. Jon did that the other day, too. Out of the 4 I&rsquo;ve seen bought, 2 have spilled. Them&rsquo;s bad odds. We drove by the infamous Whataburger (still closed for the power outages) and there were several <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fire trucks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around it, inexplicably. Some guys were talking in front of one of them. Nothing appeared to be wrong. Then ten minutes later they sped by with sirens blaring to go somewhere more important(?). At Barnes and Noble I bought a book called &ldquo;An ABC of Music&rdquo; by Imogen Holst (daughter of Gustav Holst, who did <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Planets<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It&rsquo;s a music theory book. I hope to learn from it. I didn&rsquo;t read too far, then the tornadoes hit. Deadly tornadoes. They didn&rsquo;t hit us though. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe there weren&rsquo;t any tornadoes at all. I didn&rsquo;t check. Then I went to sleep.</p>

			 <p>Jim dropped by. He has the back of his neck pierced. Then nothing happened all day. Then I went to Jon&rsquo;s for Memorial Day. We had brisket and discussed our summer plans and what we were thankful for. I was thankful for our veterans and for plastics. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plastics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> make it possible. Then I stayed at Jon&rsquo;s until around 11:30 when we left to go to TV network parking lots. We went to Channel 4, but this guy with what was possibly a kidney in a cooler told us they weren&rsquo;t open. He and the bellboy then stared at us. Who knows? Then we met Jesse at the Whataburger that was closed. The 24-hour Whataburger was closed! So we went to Wal-Mart. Then I stayed up until 6:30 at Jon&rsquo;s then went home. Full day.</p>

			 <p>Today I spent 5 hours (!) at CD Outlet. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, CD Outlet is essentially where all the overflow CDs that don&rsquo;t sell at CD Warehouse go to. I ended up buying 6 albums (for only 20 dollars total!). One was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T99 - &ldquo;Children of Chaos&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is about the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a long time. Too bad it was their only album. I can&rsquo;t believe I wasted so much time there today though. I found a lot of weird stuff including a Buddhist-monk-style chant CD of songs such as &ldquo;The Monkees Theme&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hey, Hey! We&rsquo;re the Monks! People say we monkey around! But we&rsquo;re too busy chanting, to put anybody down!&quot;) and even Smells Like Teen Spirit. Didn&rsquo;t get it, but I&rsquo;ll buy it next time though.</p>

			 <p>Hung out with Veronica today. We drove all around. We must have passed Martin Luther King Blvd about a million times. Also I got to see the Myriad Botanical Gardens for the first time. That Crystal Bridge sure is a weird thing. It was designed by I. M. Pei. He designed the pyramid at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Louvre<!-- raw HTML omitted --> also. I wonder how he ended up doing something for, of all places, Oklahoma City?</p>

			 <p>Today I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wherehouse Music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and bought&hellip; nothing. After that I went to a Casady end-of-school party, and this time everyone seemed to recognize me. But we left when it got pretty crappy. It was at this house way out east that was all fancy architecturally. We (Jon, Austin, and I) passed out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->N<em>SYNC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stickers to everyone. (My dad gave them to us, oddly enough, right before we left. You should have seen the look on Jon&rsquo;s face when my dad said &ldquo;Hey Grant, before you go, I have those <!-- raw HTML omitted -->N</em>SYNC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stickers for you!&quot;)</p>

			 <p>Added some more links. I wrote all my thank you letters for graduation gifts today. Also added actual content to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HOME<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page. I really enjoy putting an excessive amount of links on everything. Whenever I have the chance I make something a link. I put my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->e-mail address<!-- raw HTML omitted --> up finally. It&rsquo;s about time. I want lots of e-mail. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put up a discussion board thing. I want to feel like people actually visit this thing. Maybe I should wait until I have actual content.</p>
