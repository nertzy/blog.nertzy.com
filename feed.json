Some of my favorites was his &#8220;Classical Favorites&#8221; tracks, available from his <a href=\"http://virt.vgmix.com/index.php?page=chip\">chiptunes</a> page, albeit in tracker formats.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, I was spending a lot of my own free time writing music with Impulse Tracker, so I dabbled a little bit in faking NES music, in my &#8220;LOFI&#8221; series, with some pleasing results. This was back around 2000 or so. I never quite got back into it, sadly.</p>\n\n<p>Later on, I discovered <a href=\"http://8bitpeoples.com/\">8bitpeoples</a>, a musical collective of chiptune artists. I went to their <a href=\"http://www.8bitpeoples.com/destroy/\">Data Destruction Tour</a> in Boston and got to talk to and admire the music of <a href=\"http://bit.shifter.net/\">Bit Shifter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nullsleep.com/\">Nullsleep</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.covox.net\">Covox</a>.

Needless to say, I got pretty stoked.</p>\n\n<p>This revived my long-standing desire to get one of the handful of different Game Boy cartridges that people have made for writing chiptunes.

For this track, I kept things simple by only writing one pattern for each of the four available channels. I merely turn them on and off at strategic times to create the structure of the track.

				"content_html": "<p>On Sunday I drove to Houston to shop for furniture at <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com\">IKEA</a>, since my apartment only has an inflatable mattress right now. The plan was to drive the three hours, look through all the furniture I could, and get as much of what I need as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Now several of my friends have told me about IKEA, so I knew I was headed toward something a bit different.</p>\n\n<p>The drive to Houston was relatively uneventful. I listened to <a href=\"http://www.hibob.fm\">Bob FM</a>, singing along to Deep Blue Something&#8217;s &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s&#8221; and the song that reminds us, and Bill and Ted, that we are just &#8220;dust in the wind&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>I arrived and was instantly taken by the amusement-park-like parking lot. There were families all around loading up new furniture for the kids, young couples filling out their new shared homes, and a mish-mash of foreign languages.</p>\n\n<p>I walked inside hungry, so I immediately headed for the Caf√© next to the Exit. The customer experience at IKEA is very well-defined beforehand, so it felt quite unnatural to go straight to the Exit Caf√©. I wanted to get Swedish meatballs, as advertised, but couldn&#8217;t find them. I settled for two hot dogs and a Swedish pear soda.</p>\n\n<p>Unfazed, I set on my journey through the store. I brought in my laptop in hopes of finding a free wireless internet connection inside. I take whatever I can these days.</p>\n\n<p>But alas I found none, and realized I would get tired spending five hours lugging my new corporate behemoth 17&#8221; Macbook Pro on my back. So I quickly dashed through the preset IKEA path and out the exit, hoping no one would think I was trying to steal the tiny clipboard in my backpack that could have easily been found in the home organization section downstairs.</p>\n\n<p>Have once again ruined the pre-planned shopping experience, I set out to find a couch. A few hours later I was still weighing my options and had to move on for fear of running out of time.</p>\n\n<p>Perpetually clutching my little IKEA note card was my left hand, whose thumb began pulsating with a painful tightness. I dropped my things into my shopping bag and kept on, trying to help my hand relax.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually decided on a nice dark brown table and a matching bed with foam mattress. When I picked up the pieces I found they were out of dark brown bed frames so I snagged a medium brown last minute. I popped into the checkout line and grabbed a last-minute spot purchase five dollar welcome mat. Mission accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>Or rather, mission accepted, because little did I know what was still in store for me upon my fateful return.</p>\n\n<p>I spent half an hour trying to get twine properly tied around the furniture pieces on top of my car. My Boy Scout skills only got me so far and I asked for help, after most of the families and more frantic customers had been helped. The IKEA employee started to really wrap it up well as he noticed I had tied my car doors shut.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;You going to climb in through the window?&#8221; he half-jokingly suggested, and I made sure it was possible and said, &#8220;Sure, why not?&#8221; He proceeded to secure my goods firmly atop my Chevrolet Impala, and I stuffed myself into my car.</p>\n\n<p>As I often do, I checked for all of my belongings before I left. That&#8217;s when I realized I couldn&#8217;t find my wallet. Now, I had just used it to buy the very furniture that was blocking me from fully searching the interior of my car. I had already found all of the various pocket gizmos that I had haphazardly dumped onto my car floorboard. But still no wallet.</p>\n\n<p>Unfazed, I went back into the store and asked if anyone had found it. Alas, no one had. They promised to give me a call if it shows up, and try to arrange to ship it to Austin when and if it does.</p>\n\n<p>So, without any way to pay for things, I set off back to Austin. Right then I realized I didn&#8217;t have enough gas to go the whole way. Surely it will show up. Alternatively, I can wing something, I decided, and I was on my way.</p>\n\n<p>About an hour later, as I listened to two nerds on a radio show incessantly discuss computer games and the 25th anniversary of the IBM PC, a large bright streak shot through the sky in front of me. In a second, the light appeared, shot down at about a 30-degree angle with the ground, and exploded into many small bright bits, fading into nothingness.</p>\n\n<p>I halfway braced for an explosion, unsure if I had seen a meteor or a missile. Either way, if anything was left at impact it could have made quite a large blast. But instead, I only found silence. I immediately called my parents, who confirmed I had witnessed one of the <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/07aug_perseids.htm\">Perseids</a>. Here I was during the prime time of the meteor shower, driving late at night along desolate Texas countryside. The timing was just too perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I was alert, I kept on trucking. I spent a great deal of time trying to find a good station to listen to <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Matt Drudge</a>&#8217;s radio show. I constantly had to switch between five stations that I could barely pick up, all of which carried Drudge&#8217;s droning voice and characteristic long silences.</p>\n\n<p>As I neared the small town of Elgin, my fuel light came on. I needed to get some gas if I was going to make it the final 50 miles. I realized I had a stash of coins for use on toll roads, so I looked for a 24-hour gas station. Instead all I found were closed, dark convenience stores and their well-lit but credit-card-only gas pumps. No good without my wallet, which as yet hadn&#8217;t showed up.</p>\n\n<p>I pulled into an empty <a href=\"http://www.heb.com\">H.E.B. supermarket</a> parking lot and sized up my situation. A nice man wearing a U.S. Postal Service shirt pulled in to fill up his car, and I reluctantly asked him to help me.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Could you give me five dollars of gas?&#8221; I asked, explaining my situation. I played to his sympathies by adding that I was newly out of college and couldn&#8217;t even get in the doors of my car.</p>\n\n<p>I explained to him very nicely that if he put his credit card in the pump, he could pump about five dollars in himself, and I would be willing to pay him in change or mail him a check. He wasn&#8217;t biting, and rightfully so, considering the absurdity and my lack of ability to faithfully prove my car wasn&#8217;t stolen.</p>\n\n<p>He found this situation puzzling and tried his best to help. However, the best advice he could come up in his confusion was for me to take the pieces off of the top of my car and load them inside, which I think would be impossible and also not helpful.</p>\n\n<p>He pointed me down the road to the still-open Chevron station. It was now about a half hour past midnight.</p>\n\n<p>I waited until no one was looking, pulled up to the Chevron gas pump, then climbed out my window. Inside, I told the lady working there my entire situation and then handed her two Susan B. Anthony dollars, five quarters, five nickels, and four dimes, for a grand total of $3.90.</p>\n\n<p>Back outside (it was prepay) I filled up my car, as the worker lady stepped out for a smoke. I was pumping gas and this lady is <em>smoking</em>? Luckily my just over a gallon of gas did not take long and I got out of there. I predicted to myself that the fuel light would come on again as I pulled into my apartment complex.</p>\n\n<p>I got into Austin, ever eyeing my gas meter as it dwindled but held on. I was making good distance, and would make it!</p>\n\n<p>I got onto US Highway 183, and took the access road under Interstate 35. The construction was everywhere, and the plethora of completed and incomplete highway ramps made for an interesting scene. A few police cars had their lights on to signal the construction, as I had seen a few days earlier in the same spot after a wrong turn.</p>\n\n<p>But the Police were otherwise busy, I discovered. As the light finally turned green and I drove past, I watched as an officer guided a handcuffed man into the back seat of his cruiser. The timing of my drive by framed the shot just as any television drama might have.</p>\n\n<p>Still trapped in my car, hoping the doors were securely shut, and still unable to shut the windows enough to mute the loud highway noise, I pressed on. Finally I pulled into my apartment complex and watched as, surely enough, my fuel light turned on.</p>\n\n<p>I unloaded my car, refreshed that I could finally use its doors. But still, I found no wallet.</p>\n\n<p>I left my small cart that I used for the heavy pieces out on the apartment drive. As I was composing myself inside I heard a rattling outside and realized that someone was taking it. I ran outside, only to find my cart sitting in the hallway outside my neighbor&#8217;s door. No one was to be found.</p>\n\n<p>So I quickly nabbed the cart and brought it inside. I heard some people run down the stairs outside and decided to pop back out to explain the case of the mysterious disappearing cart, but once again they were nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n<p>So I went inside to cancel my credit cards.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily I had already lost my debit card last Thursday by leaving it in the drive-up ATM, so its replacement is on the way. Until then I will probably have to rely on writing checks and hoping people will take my expired passport as valid ID.</p>\n\n<p>I still need to get my Texas driver license, car title, inspection, and license plate. For new residents, there is a specific process one must follow, as everything depends on something else.</p>\n\n<p>But without my Oklahoma driver license, I probably cannot get my car inspected, and an un-inspected car cannot get its title paid, and an untitled car cannot be used to get a new Texas license, even ignoring the fact that my lack of my Oklahoma license will probably force me to take another driving test anyway. And last but not least, I won&#8217;t be able to get a Texas license plate to replace my Oklahoma plate, which expired at the beginning of the month.</p>\n\n<p>And on top of all this I&#8217;m switching over my auto insurance, which is why I waited to get my inspection in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I better not get pulled over, because I won&#8217;t have identification, a valid license plate, a license, or even an inspection sticker. Cross your fingers for me.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not really even a concern because I only have checks as a method of spending money, and I doubt I can get to a gas station that wouldn&#8217;t ask to see ID using only the sixteenth of a tank I have left. Needless to say, I hope my new ATM card comes in the mail by tomorrow morning. Not that I would know where to go anyway because I still have no internet access.</p>\n\n<p>But at least I still have my health!</p>\n\n<p>As long as you ignore the carpal tunnel attack.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This post may sound negative but really I am enjoying the absurdity of it all. I&#8217;m doing fine and should be able to get through all of this with only the required amount of elbow grease.</p>\n",

Mission accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>Or rather, mission accepted, because little did I know what was still in store for me upon my fateful return.</p>\n\n<p>I spent half an hour trying to get twine properly tied around the furniture pieces on top of my car. My Boy Scout skills only got me so far and I asked for help, after most of the families and more frantic customers had been helped. The IKEA employee started to really wrap it up well as he noticed I had tied my car doors shut.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;You going to climb in through the window?&#8221; he half-jokingly suggested, and I made sure it was possible and said, &#8220;Sure, why not?&#8221; He proceeded to secure my goods firmly atop my Chevrolet Impala, and I stuffed myself into my car.</p>\n\n<p>As I often do, I checked for all of my belongings before I left. That&#8217;s when I realized I couldn&#8217;t find my wallet. Now, I had just used it to buy the very furniture that was blocking me from fully searching the interior of my car. I had already found all of the various pocket gizmos that I had haphazardly dumped onto my car floorboard. But still no wallet.</p>\n\n<p>Unfazed, I went back into the store and asked if anyone had found it. Alas, no one had. They promised to give me a call if it shows up, and try to arrange to ship it to Austin when and if it does.</p>\n\n<p>So, without any way to pay for things, I set off back to Austin. Right then I realized I didn&#8217;t have enough gas to go the whole way. Surely it will show up. Alternatively, I can wing something, I decided, and I was on my way.</p>\n\n<p>About an hour later, as I listened to two nerds on a radio show incessantly discuss computer games and the 25th anniversary of the IBM PC, a large bright streak shot through the sky in front of me. In a second, the light appeared, shot down at about a 30-degree angle with the ground, and exploded into many small bright bits, fading into nothingness.</p>\n\n<p>I halfway braced for an explosion, unsure if I had seen a meteor or a missile. Either way, if anything was left at impact it could have made quite a large blast. But instead, I only found silence. I immediately called my parents, who confirmed I had witnessed one of the <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/07aug_perseids.htm\">Perseids</a>. Here I was during the prime time of the meteor shower, driving late at night along desolate Texas countryside. The timing was just too perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I was alert, I kept on trucking. I spent a great deal of time trying to find a good station to listen to <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Matt Drudge</a>&#8217;s radio show. I constantly had to switch between five stations that I could barely pick up, all of which carried Drudge&#8217;s droning voice and characteristic long silences.</p>\n\n<p>As I neared the small town of Elgin, my fuel light came on. I needed to get some gas if I was going to make it the final 50 miles. I realized I had a stash of coins for use on toll roads, so I looked for a 24-hour gas station. Instead all I found were closed, dark convenience stores and their well-lit but credit-card-only gas pumps. No good without my wallet, which as yet hadn&#8217;t showed up.</p>\n\n<p>I pulled into an empty <a href=\"http://www.heb.com\">H.E.B. supermarket</a> parking lot and sized up my situation. A nice man wearing a U.S. Postal Service shirt pulled in to fill up his car, and I reluctantly asked him to help me.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Could you give me five dollars of gas?&#8221; I asked, explaining my situation. I played to his sympathies by adding that I was newly out of college and couldn&#8217;t even get in the doors of my car.</p>\n\n<p>I explained to him very nicely that if he put his credit card in the pump, he could pump about five dollars in himself, and I would be willing to pay him in change or mail him a check. He wasn&#8217;t biting, and rightfully so, considering the absurdity and my lack of ability to faithfully prove my car wasn&#8217;t stolen.</p>\n\n<p>He found this situation puzzling and tried his best to help. However, the best advice he could come up in his confusion was for me to take the pieces off of the top of my car and load them inside, which I think would be impossible and also not helpful.</p>\n\n<p>He pointed me down the road to the still-open Chevron station. It was now about a half hour past midnight.</p>\n\n<p>I waited until no one was looking, pulled up to the Chevron gas pump, then climbed out my window. Inside, I told the lady working there my entire situation and then handed her two Susan B. Anthony dollars, five quarters, five nickels, and four dimes, for a grand total of $3.90.</p>\n\n<p>Back outside (it was prepay) I filled up my car, as the worker lady stepped out for a smoke. I was pumping gas and this lady is <em>smoking</em>? Luckily my just over a gallon of gas did not take long and I got out of there. I predicted to myself that the fuel light would come on again as I pulled into my apartment complex.</p>\n\n<p>I got into Austin, ever eyeing my gas meter as it dwindled but held on. I was making good distance, and would make it!</p>\n\n<p>I got onto US Highway 183, and took the access road under Interstate 35. The construction was everywhere, and the plethora of completed and incomplete highway ramps made for an interesting scene. A few police cars had their lights on to signal the construction, as I had seen a few days earlier in the same spot after a wrong turn.</p>\n\n<p>But the Police were otherwise busy, I discovered. As the light finally turned green and I drove past, I watched as an officer guided a handcuffed man into the back seat of his cruiser. The timing of my drive by framed the shot just as any television drama might have.</p>\n\n<p>Still trapped in my car, hoping the doors were securely shut, and still unable to shut the windows enough to mute the loud highway noise, I pressed on. Finally I pulled into my apartment complex and watched as, surely enough, my fuel light turned on.</p>\n\n<p>I unloaded my car, refreshed that I could finally use its doors. But still, I found no wallet.</p>\n\n<p>I left my small cart that I used for the heavy pieces out on the apartment drive. As I was composing myself inside I heard a rattling outside and realized that someone was taking it. I ran outside, only to find my cart sitting in the hallway outside my neighbor&#8217;s door. No one was to be found.</p>\n\n<p>So I quickly nabbed the cart and brought it inside. I heard some people run down the stairs outside and decided to pop back out to explain the case of the mysterious disappearing cart, but once again they were nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n<p>So I went inside to cancel my credit cards.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily I had already lost my debit card last Thursday by leaving it in the drive-up ATM, so its replacement is on the way. Until then I will probably have to rely on writing checks and hoping people will take my expired passport as valid ID.</p>\n\n<p>I still need to get my Texas driver license, car title, inspection, and license plate. For new residents, there is a specific process one must follow, as everything depends on something else.</p>\n\n<p>But without my Oklahoma driver license, I probably cannot get my car inspected, and an un-inspected car cannot get its title paid, and an untitled car cannot be used to get a new Texas license, even ignoring the fact that my lack of my Oklahoma license will probably force me to take another driving test anyway. And last but not least, I won&#8217;t be able to get a Texas license plate to replace my Oklahoma plate, which expired at the beginning of the month.</p>\n\n<p>And on top of all this I&#8217;m switching over my auto insurance, which is why I waited to get my inspection in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I better not get pulled over, because I won&#8217;t have identification, a valid license plate, a license, or even an inspection sticker. Cross your fingers for me.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not really even a concern because I only have checks as a method of spending money, and I doubt I can get to a gas station that wouldn&#8217;t ask to see ID using only the sixteenth of a tank I have left. Needless to say, I hope my new ATM card comes in the mail by tomorrow morning. Not that I would know where to go anyway because I still have no internet access.</p>\n\n<p>But at least I still have my health!</p>\n\n<p>As long as you ignore the carpal tunnel attack.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This post may sound negative but really I am enjoying the absurdity of it all. I&#8217;m doing fine and should be able to get through all of this with only the required amount of elbow grease.</p>\n",

She explained the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method\">Suzuki Method</a> to me (although I feel like I might have gotten the name wrong after reading that Wikipedia entry). She&#8217;s going to be in Euripides&#8217;s <em>Bacchae</em> later this semester. I might go usher that as well to enrich the 1/4 of myself that is Greek. It&#8217;d be a good way to get out of Olin a little more.</p>\n",

Sure, there are plenty of fallacies, but I don't really have the time and ability to properly research and find them in the swaths of media I read every day.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Ten years ago on this day I sat working on an assignment for my math\nclass.&nbsp; I had tested out of a chapter of work and was working by\nmyself on a project to present to the class.<br>\n<br>\nSitting in the independent project classroom, we felt the building\nshake.&nbsp; At first the teacher told us it was probably a sonic\nboom.&nbsp; She used to live near an air force base, and recently on\nthe news people had talked about the possibility of stationing B2\nstealth bombers at Tinker Air Force Base.&nbsp; I thought it could have\nbeen an earthquake.<br>\n<br>\nWe looked out the window and saw a plume of smoke, like a brush fire, about 10 miles away.<br>\n<br>\nAround 9:00 am on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh drove a Ryder truck\nfull of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and nitromethane racing fuel in\nfront of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma\nCity.&nbsp; At 9:02 am the truck detonated, ultimately killing 168\npeople, from ATF agents to children in a daycare center.&nbsp; At the\ntime it was by far the largest terrorist attack on American soil, and\nto this day it remains the largest domestic terrorist attack.&nbsp; The\ndeath toll came out to approximately 13 times that of Columbine, the\nschool shooting that would take place exactly four years and one day\nlater.<br>\n<br>\nReports came back to school slowly.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t really know what\nwas going on, but over time it became clear that it wasn&rsquo;t\nnormal.&nbsp; Some students were told that their parents were OK.&nbsp;\nSomething had happened downtown, and everyone was waiting on more\ninformation.<br>\n<br>\nMy mom ran outside, thinking that a plane had exploded in the\nair.&nbsp; She had her window open and could hear the blast from 15\nmiles away.&nbsp; She later went to the local Wal-Mart and saw a\nphotographer run in to get pictures developed.&nbsp; They need to get\ndeveloped now!&nbsp; They need to get to the media&hellip;<br>\n<br>\nThat day was the first day my aunt was to do court reporting for a\nfederal trial, instead of the local and state trials she had been doing\nbefore.&nbsp; She sat in court in the Federal Courthouse, immediately\nbehind the Murrah building, certainly on the side one would rather be\non.&nbsp; Her cassette tape recording of the trial caught the blare of\nan enormous explosion, following by frantic voices and the judge\nordering everyone to immediately leave the building because a bomb had\ngone off.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I got home CNN was showing the same thing as the local news, and\nevery other channel for that matter.&nbsp; Bulletins were put out for\n&ldquo;middle eastern terrorists&rdquo; that never panned out.&nbsp; A white\nsupremacist Gulf War veteran named Timothy McVeigh was arrested for\nexcessive speeding going north on I-35, away from the blast.<br>\n<br>\nOnce everyone figured out that it was a truck bomb, and the dust\nsettled, people began the rescue effort.&nbsp; From all over the\ncountry, and indeed the world, firefighters, police, medical personnel,\nand volunteers poured in to help.&nbsp; Some of these officials would\nlater die in the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center.&nbsp;\nRobots were used to dig through the rubble in the hopes of finding\nsurvivors.&nbsp; After a few days, these hopes were dashed and families\nhad to admit defeat.<br>\n<br>\nOn Thursday, my parents took me and my brothers downtown to catch a\nglimpse.&nbsp; We weren&rsquo;t going to get close, just get within\neyeshot.&nbsp; It was a media circus.&nbsp; It seemed like every local\nnews station in America had a van parked there.&nbsp; Police lines were\neverywhere, blocking square miles of downtown.&nbsp; Some extra line\nwas hanging off of a tree and I cut off a piece of it, which I have to\nthis day.&nbsp; You could see the damage clearly from a mile\naway.&nbsp; The mood was somber and quiet and people were moving about\nmatter-of-factly.<br>\n<br>\nA week later, once all hope was lost, and to further protect the\nimmediate area by preventing an imminent collapse, the Murrah buidling\nwas imploded and cleared away.<br>\n<br>\nApril 19.&nbsp; The date doesn&rsquo;t mean much outside of Oklahoma, but\nthere it automatically means the bombing.&nbsp; A nameless federal\nbuilding housing seemingly unrelated federal offices that I had never\nheard of was attacked by a man who wanted to avenge the botched siege\nby federal agents of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, TX, two years\nearlier.<br>\n<br>\nNo one really knew why Oklahoma City should be a target.&nbsp; Everyone\nin the nation started talking about the &ldquo;heartland&rdquo;.&nbsp; It was\n&ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/US/OKC/facts/Bombing/Terror5-4/index.html\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">terror in the heartland</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Where you&rsquo;d least expect it.&nbsp; The\ngovernor of Oklahoma was on national television constantly, and each\nday the police would report to the public the updated tally of those\nwho had died.&nbsp; It ended at 168.<br>\n<br>\nMonths later, the State of Ohio donated some trees to plant at the\nState Capitol, one each for the people who died.&nbsp; I was a Boy\nScout, in Troop 78, and I volunteered that day.&nbsp; I was up on stage\nduring the dedication holding the Oklahoma flag up so that it wouldn&rsquo;t\nfall over in the wind.&nbsp; That was the first and only time that I\nheard the names of those killed read aloud.&nbsp; It took about 45\nminutes.&nbsp; Many if not most of the survivors were there, as well as\nfamilies, planting trees for the people they knew and loved.<br>\n<br>\nJust over six years later, terrorists attacked four planes, New York\nCity, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;

				"content_text": "Ten years ago on this day I sat working on an assignment for my math\nclass.&nbsp; I had tested out of a chapter of work and was working by\nmyself on a project to present to the class.<br>\n<br>\nSitting in the independent project classroom, we felt the building\nshake.&nbsp; At first the teacher told us it was probably a sonic\nboom.&nbsp; She used to live near an air force base, and recently on\nthe news people had talked about the possibility of stationing B2\nstealth bombers at Tinker Air Force Base.&nbsp; I thought it could have\nbeen an earthquake.<br>\n<br>\nWe looked out the window and saw a plume of smoke, like a brush fire, about 10 miles away.<br>\n<br>\nAround 9:00 am on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh drove a Ryder truck\nfull of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and nitromethane racing fuel in\nfront of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma\nCity.&nbsp; At 9:02 am the truck detonated, ultimately killing 168\npeople, from ATF agents to children in a daycare center.&nbsp; At the\ntime it was by far the largest terrorist attack on American soil, and\nto this day it remains the largest domestic terrorist attack.&nbsp; The\ndeath toll came out to approximately 13 times that of Columbine, the\nschool shooting that would take place exactly four years and one day\nlater.<br>\n<br>\nReports came back to school slowly.&nbsp; We didn't really know what\nwas going on, but over time it became clear that it wasn't\nnormal.&nbsp; Some students were told that their parents were OK.&nbsp;\nSomething had happened downtown, and everyone was waiting on more\ninformation.<br>\n<br>\nMy mom ran outside, thinking that a plane had exploded in the\nair.&nbsp; She had her window open and could hear the blast from 15\nmiles away.&nbsp; She later went to the local Wal-Mart and saw a\nphotographer run in to get pictures developed.&nbsp; They need to get\ndeveloped now!&nbsp; They need to get to the media...<br>\n<br>\nThat day was the first day my aunt was to do court reporting for a\nfederal trial, instead of the local and state trials she had been doing\nbefore.&nbsp; She sat in court in the Federal Courthouse, immediately\nbehind the Murrah building, certainly on the side one would rather be\non.&nbsp; Her cassette tape recording of the trial caught the blare of\nan enormous explosion, following by frantic voices and the judge\nordering everyone to immediately leave the building because a bomb had\ngone off.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I got home CNN was showing the same thing as the local news, and\nevery other channel for that matter.&nbsp; Bulletins were put out for\n\"middle eastern terrorists\" that never panned out.&nbsp; A white\nsupremacist Gulf War veteran named Timothy McVeigh was arrested for\nexcessive speeding going north on I-35, away from the blast.<br>\n<br>\nOnce everyone figured out that it was a truck bomb, and the dust\nsettled, people began the rescue effort.&nbsp; From all over the\ncountry, and indeed the world, firefighters, police, medical personnel,\nand volunteers poured in to help.&nbsp; Some of these officials would\nlater die in the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center.&nbsp;\nRobots were used to dig through the rubble in the hopes of finding\nsurvivors.&nbsp; After a few days, these hopes were dashed and families\nhad to admit defeat.<br>\n<br>\nOn Thursday, my parents took me and my brothers downtown to catch a\nglimpse.&nbsp; We weren't going to get close, just get within\neyeshot.&nbsp; It was a media circus.&nbsp; It seemed like every local\nnews station in America had a van parked there.&nbsp; Police lines were\neverywhere, blocking square miles of downtown.&nbsp; Some extra line\nwas hanging off of a tree and I cut off a piece of it, which I have to\nthis day.&nbsp; You could see the damage clearly from a mile\naway.&nbsp; The mood was somber and quiet and people were moving about\nmatter-of-factly.<br>\n<br>\nA week later, once all hope was lost, and to further protect the\nimmediate area by preventing an imminent collapse, the Murrah buidling\nwas imploded and cleared away.<br>\n<br>\nApril 19.&nbsp; The date doesn't mean much outside of Oklahoma, but\nthere it automatically means the bombing.&nbsp; A nameless federal\nbuilding housing seemingly unrelated federal offices that I had never\nheard of was attacked by a man who wanted to avenge the botched siege\nby federal agents of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, TX, two years\nearlier.<br>\n<br>\nNo one really knew why Oklahoma City should be a target.&nbsp; Everyone\nin the nation started talking about the \"heartland\".&nbsp; It was\n\"<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/US/OKC/facts/Bombing/Terror5-4/index.html\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">terror in the heartland</a>\".&nbsp; Where you'd least expect it.&nbsp; The\ngovernor of Oklahoma was on national television constantly, and each\nday the police would report to the public the updated tally of those\nwho had died.&nbsp; It ended at 168.<br>\n<br>\nMonths later, the State of Ohio donated some trees to plant at the\nState Capitol, one each for the people who died.&nbsp; I was a Boy\nScout, in Troop 78, and I volunteered that day.&nbsp; I was up on stage\nduring the dedication holding the Oklahoma flag up so that it wouldn't\nfall over in the wind.&nbsp; That was the first and only time that I\nheard the names of those killed read aloud.&nbsp; It took about 45\nminutes.&nbsp; Many if not most of the survivors were there, as well as\nfamilies, planting trees for the people they knew and loved.<br>\n<br>\nJust over six years later, terrorists attacked four planes, New York\nCity, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Perhaps the worst part\nabout that day was knowing how it would play out, what the aftermath\nwould be.&nbsp; First off, remember the date, September 11, we'll be\nhearing about this for some time, just like April 19.&nbsp; Second,\nthere will be a relief effort.&nbsp; People will come from all over to\ndig through the rubble in order to find survivors.&nbsp; Third, the\ntime will come where no one could be expected to live under this\nrubble.&nbsp;

Soon I will have an update for the <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/bowling.html\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grant Bowls!</a> page of my sister site <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grant Page Central</a>,\nwhich is in dire need of an update.&nbsp; My plan is to convert Grant\nPage Central into a static content site of my musical works, some\nwritings, and of course bowling scores, while letting this page, Grant\nPage X, be my blog.<br>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></span>\n",

Other than that I think I'm going to take a class at\nWellesley, although I haven't decided on one yet.</p>\n<p>I've recently been hired to do the Research Working Group\nwebsite. It's nice to actually have content and a goal for making\na webpage. Maybe somewhere in the process I'll get some ideas for\nthis page.</p>\n<p>I'm coming home for Thanksgiving! I'm pretty excited, since\nI've really wanted to see my family lately.</p>\n",

Anyway, I now have thirty discs more than\nbefore.</p>\n<p>Jon is headed to the <a href=\"http://www.sundance.org/\">Sundance Film Festival</a>! On\ntwo days‚Äô notice, he‚Äôs headed to sunny California to\nmeet with <a href=\"http://www.paintinglight.net/\">Jesse</a> and\ndrive to also sunny Utah. There he will watch several independent\nfilms and attend several parties and just in general do a lot of\nschmoozing. I know it will be great and he‚Äôll have plenty\nto talk about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stargateinc.com\">Stargate, Inc.</a> sells\ndomain names for only eight dollars a year. If you want one,\nthey‚Äôre so cheap it‚Äôs almost worth grabbing a couple.\nJon nabbed normalform.com again. I‚Äôm mulling over getting\none myself. The other Grant lists several <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com/domain/\">interesting domain names\nthat have no owner</a>.</p>\n<p>My room now has the bed and television switched, among other\nthings. Right in time for me to fly home this Monday!

I said ‚Äúbake‚Äù and\nhe said ‚Äúbroil‚Äù. The jury is still out on that, but I\nstill think that it came out well after being baked for about\neighteen minutes.

The first oddity I came across was <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com\">Splorp</a>. I have been thinking of\ndoing an independent study‚Äâ/‚Äâpassionate pursuit (as\nwe call them) on typography. Essentially I‚Äôve been\nconsidering designing my own font and getting some side credit\nfor it. Well after casually browsing I found this Splorp site\nwhich is a blog of a certain Grant Hutchinson. Grant Hutchinson\nwho has made fonts and is interested in several things I am also\ninterested in. Grant Hutchinson who <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com/about/\">brags</a> that he is number\none when you search for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Grant+Hutchinson%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search\">\n‚ÄúGrant Hutchinson‚Äù</a> on Google.

Needless to\nsay he will be receiving an email in his inbox shortly relating\nto this matter.</p>\n<p>The scary thing is that this isn‚Äôt the first time\nI‚Äôve run into this strange <a href=\"http://webhome.idirect.com/~donlong/monsters/Html/Doppelga.htm\">\ndoppelganger</a> phenomenon. A few years back when I was\nconsidering becoming a Japanese translator, I found a Grant\nHutchins who lives in Oregon and is a Japanese translator.\nNeedless to say I feel less unique when I find these people.</p>\n<p>Another oddity I‚Äôve found is this shoddy <a href=\"http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs2002b/Welcome_Opening_Page.htm\">\ncollege report on medieval British literature</a> that stole the\nimage of Olin‚Äôs campus. Why did this person decide to steal\nan image from our website and reassign the Academic Center as a\n<a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/English/Beowulf/eBeowulf/guide.htm\">\nBeowulf</a> museum?

				"content_text": "<p>Oklahoma in 2 days</p>\n<p>I poked around on the Internet a lot these last few days of\nfreshman semester I. The first oddity I came across was <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com\">Splorp</a>. I have been thinking of\ndoing an independent study‚Äâ/‚Äâpassionate pursuit (as\nwe call them) on typography. Essentially I‚Äôve been\nconsidering designing my own font and getting some side credit\nfor it. Well after casually browsing I found this Splorp site\nwhich is a blog of a certain Grant Hutchinson. Grant Hutchinson\nwho has made fonts and is interested in several things I am also\ninterested in. Grant Hutchinson who <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com/about/\">brags</a> that he is number\none when you search for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Grant+Hutchinson%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search\">\n‚ÄúGrant Hutchinson‚Äù</a> on Google.

Needless to\nsay he will be receiving an email in his inbox shortly relating\nto this matter.</p>\n<p>The scary thing is that this isn‚Äôt the first time\nI‚Äôve run into this strange <a href=\"http://webhome.idirect.com/~donlong/monsters/Html/Doppelga.htm\">\ndoppelganger</a> phenomenon. A few years back when I was\nconsidering becoming a Japanese translator, I found a Grant\nHutchins who lives in Oregon and is a Japanese translator.\nNeedless to say I feel less unique when I find these people.</p>\n<p>Another oddity I‚Äôve found is this shoddy <a href=\"http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs2002b/Welcome_Opening_Page.htm\">\ncollege report on medieval British literature</a> that stole the\nimage of Olin‚Äôs campus. Why did this person decide to steal\nan image from our website and reassign the Academic Center as a\n<a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/English/Beowulf/eBeowulf/guide.htm\">\nBeowulf</a> museum?

I literally watched it\nget marked down from 30% to 40% off. That‚Äôs like 40 bucks\nless. My brothers and I are going to form a band and try to\nrecord some music over Christmas break.

He‚Äôll also have been off tour\nfor a week at home in New York City, so he should be even more\nenergetic than ever. Moby is also not only the headliner, but the\n<em>only</em> act playing. This means he will get all sorts of\ntime to try new things and wow the crowd. Plus, the Paradise is\nsuch a cozy venue, where it‚Äôs literally impossible to stand\nmore than about 30 feet from the stage. The show was sold out\nright after I decided to go, so I perused <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com\">eBay</a> for <a href=\"http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&amp;krd=1&amp;from=R8&amp;MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;SortProperty=MetaEndSort&amp;query=Moby+Boston\">\npeople reselling tickets</a>. However, I found them pricey, so I\nemailed a guy <a href=\"https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1941209579\">\nwhose auction didn‚Äôt sell</a> and made him an offer and now\nhave two tickets in my possession.</p>\n<p>I went to Oklahoma for Thanksgiving. The first night ended in\na controversy that lead <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com\">Jon</a>, Austin, and I to leave\nRima‚Äôs birthday party. That‚Äôs all I will say for now.\nLater that week, I bought a <a href=\"http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?A_PROD_NO=EM1\">Korg\nElectribe EM-1 Music Production Station</a>, a type of half-drum\nmachine half-synthesizer little sound unit, at <a href=\"http://www.marsmusic.com\">Mars Music</a>, which is going\nout of business and having a huge sale. I literally watched it\nget marked down from 30% to 40% off. That‚Äôs like 40 bucks\nless. My brothers and I are going to form a band and try to\nrecord some music over Christmas break. Jon plays bass and\n(increasingly) guitar, while Kyle plays drums.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been sleeping a lot lately. My naps are dominating\nmy days now. I‚Äôve got to learn to stay awake.</p>\n<p>My mom enters a lot of contests (or ‚Äúsweeps‚Äù, if\nyou‚Äôre so inclined). She wins about four or five contests a\nmonth now! The most significant prize won is an MP3 player. Now\nshe‚Äôs got me hooked on <a href=\"http://pantsofchance.leedungarees.com\">Lee Dungarees Pants\nof Chance</a>. This is the best slot machine ever. Free credits,\nand you might win oysters or tube socks. What could be\nbetter?!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.feartheclown.com\">Fear the Clown</a> named\none of my songs Song of the Day a couple weeks ago. Three of my\nfriends used to be in a band named (at times) Pivot and (at other\ntimes) <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/old/shamespiral/\">Shamespiral</a>.\nI wrote a little ambient song entitled (creatively)\n‚ÄúShamespiral Intro‚Äù that was used to introduce their\nfinal two shows. I‚Äôll throw it up on my <a href=\"music/index.html\">Grant Music</a> page in a bit.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve added some pictures to my <a href=\"pictures/index.html\">Grant Pictures</a> page.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I‚Äôm about to go to bed so I can take the <a href=\"http://math.scu.edu/putnam/\">Putnam Exam</a> tomorrow. The\nsnow everywhere reflects the moonlight and makes it feel like\nday. This will be an adventure. I prefer to sleep in total\nsensory deprivation myself.</p>\n",

We wrote a program in\n<a href=\"https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/\">MATLAB</a>\nthat measures the temperature and then controls the hot plate so\nthat the water ends up at <a href=\"http://www.billzilla.org/f1story.htm\">exactly 50 degrees\nCelsius</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I'm leaving for the Big Apple late tomorrow\nnight. I'm excited because Tucker and I are going to a really\nnice Mexican restaurant. Dan, Tucker, and I went to Taco Bell\nafter the Area 2 show and it was like manna sent from heaven.\nOther than that we don't get much Mexican food up here. When I\nsay that, however, I am <a href=\"http://eric.diaryland.com/daytrip2.html\">lying through my\nteeth</a>. Our dining hall makes some really good tacos and <a href=\"http://swankivy.envy.nu/silvfern.html\">nachos and\nwhatnot</a>, as per our request. We have the freaking best dining\nhall on the planet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,823659,00.html\">\nJam Master Jay was killed today</a>. He was influential in early\n80s hip-hop and as the DJ for <a href=\"http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists/R/Run_DMC/?il=1\">\nRun-DMC</a> helped pioneer much of what music is like today. He\nwas not a gangster/thug/idiot. He leaves behind a wife and three\nchildren. It comes as a shock to see him go, as there seems to be\nno reason for anyone to have a grudge against him. He was shot\nwhile in the recording studio. News stories compare it to <a href=\"http://www.usd.edu/trio/sum97/rappers.html\">Tupac and\nNotorious B.I.G.</a> but there really is no comparison, as those\ntwo had <a href=\"http://www.compearth.com/stuntaz/\">lifestyles</a> that put\ntheir lives at risk anyway.</p>\n",

Deadsy is a weird hybrid between 80s new\nwave and late 90s-present quasi-goth <a href=\"http://www.numetalfinishing.com/\">nu-metal</a>. They also\nprominently feature synthesizers. The lead singer is P. Exeter\nBlue, who just happens to be the son of <a href=\"http://www.cher.com\">Cher</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,83,00.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Robert Altman</span></a>.\nThey do a cover of <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com\">Rush</a>'s \"<a href=\"http://www.tomsawyer.com\">Tom Sawyer</a>\" that has confused\nmany people into believing they were listening to the original.\nEach band member has a color and theme. P. Exeter Blue's theme is\nacademia (how's that for a metal band?) and his color is <a href=\"http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_761.html\">\nInternational Klein Blue</a>. Yes, <acronym title=\"International Klein Blue\"><a href=\"http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/splashwords/international.html\">\nIKB</a></acronym>! No wonder I like it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"newsupdate\">\n<div class=\"updatedate\">August 16, 2002</div>\n<div class=\"updatetext\">It turns out that it was really Greg\nAllman, of the Allman Brothers.

Tomorrow the stuff is moving to the real\ncampus! My job is quickly going to change. The Campus Center has\nbeen given a temporary unofficial occupancy permit, to hold us\nover until it gets the real one in a few days. This is a great\nthing, since we need to move in and only have 14 days left before\nclasses start. The Classroom Building and Residence Hall are\nstill lagging. Let's home I have somewhere to live a week from\nSaturday!</p>\n<p>Erin emailed me yesterday. She said she heard from <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/sykoze/\">TC</a>. I need to get in\ncontact with him. She said he might want to visit before school\nstarts, but at this rate it won't happen. Right now I'm\ncompletely out of touch with him.</p>\n<p>While at Borders, I looked through all the books. For some\nreason, only science books interest me. I don't care for fiction.\nI only like reading fact, especially about math, physics, or\ncomputers. Music too, I guess. We really need a library. We have\na pretend library over in the <acronym title=\"Modular Academic Center\">MAC</acronym> that carries <a href=\"https://www.2600.com\">2600</a>. I think that's so cool.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://www.ecsusa.com/K7VTA3_3x.cfm\">motherboard</a>'s\nstupid built-in <a href=\"http://www.fartnet.com/soundwave/oldrants/rant1.html\">sound\ncard</a> won't work. In Linux, at least. It autodetects it fine,\nbut then nothing happens and the sound server fails. Great. I'll\njust go buy a cheapo <a href=\"http://www.soundblaster.com/products/sb16pci/\">Sound\nBlaster 16</a>. Dan got this <a href=\"http://www.deadvirgins.org.uk/reborn/index.html\">program</a>\nfrom Linux that emulates two <a href=\"http://www.tb-303.org/\">303s</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.808state.com/\">808</a>, and a <a href=\"http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/Roland/TR-909/\">\n909</a>.

I hope\nto write a font someday. I might be able to convince <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu\">the college</a> to give me credit for\nit. (or perhaps just recognition on my transcript)</p>\n<p>Every student currently at Olin went to <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu/news/news_stories/rod.html\">Rod</a>'s\nhouse today. <a href=\"http://people.brandeis.edu/~lexfri/thoughts.html\">Rod\nCrafts</a> is our Dean of Student Life. He has a wonderful\nbackyard that is on a small cliff and has many levels of ground\nwith chairs set up so you can look down over the gardens below.\nWe had burgers.</p>\n<p>The new students (and all the old ones too) arrive in a couple\nweeks. We all can't wait.</p>\n<p>Look for some of <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com/citron\">my\nmusic</a> over the next few days on this site. I've been meaning\nto make a new section dedicated to my music and some MP3s. The <a href=\"http://www.riaa.org\">RIAA</a> can just cry, because they\nhave no power over my music. I used to go by the moniker <a href=\"http://john.bonobo.free.fr/citron1.htm\">Citron</a>, but now\nI'm just simply Grant Hutchins. Keep that in mind when referring\nto my music. I've been meaning to tell <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com\">Jon</a> about this for some time\nnow.</p>\n<p>Speaking of, Jon asked me for the original <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/photoshop\">Photoshop</a> file for one\nof the little <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com/nfbg.gif\">logos</a> on his <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com\">page</a>. He's making stationery\nI heard. Watch out for some new stuff soon.</p>\n<p>While I'm in the mood for plugging old friends, check out <a href=\"http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com\">Tucker</a>'s new\n<a href=\"http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com/djmixes.php\">DJ\nmix</a>, \"Trance 8.8.02\". He's amazing at mixing. My favorite\ntransition is the one in \"Electronic 5.28.02\" from <a href=\"http://www.crystalmethod.com\">Crystal Method</a>'s \"Busy\nChild\" to <a href=\"http://www.loopz.co.uk\">Orbital</a>'s\n\"<acronym title=\"&quot;August&quot; in Gaelic\">An Fhomhair</acronym>\".\nSimply amazing stuff.</p>\n",

He was really\ngood, and I found myself able to enjoy his style of music, even\nthough I&rsquo;m usually not up for it. I was dancing pretty heavily,\nso my glasses flew off my face twice. After I was sufficiently\ntired Dan and I caught the end of <a href=\"http://www.davidbowie.com/\">David Bowie</a>&rsquo;s set. A lot of\npeople there completely loved it, but I just sorta liked it. I&rsquo;m\nnot the Bowie type but it was good. After that I caught some <a href=\"http://www.carlcox.com\">Carl Cox</a> in the tent which was\nalso quite fun, but only stayed for a few minutes because of the\nimportant matter at hand:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moby.com\">Moby</a>.</p>\n<p>Moby was great, as usual. I&rsquo;ve seen him before, with Bush in\nthe Campus Invasion tour in Norman, OK. This time around he was a\nlot funnier. He had a Krusty sticker from the Simpsons on his\nguitar. He also put on a wig and acted like a metal guy for a\nwhile. He was a lot more interesting this time around, even if he\ndidn&rsquo;t play &ldquo;All I Need Is To Be Loved&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oil 1&rdquo;, two of my\nfavorite songs. He didn&rsquo;t jump on top of his keyboard or play a\nvery long guitar solo, but otherwise it was Moby at his best. The\nfirst encore he played was a quick cover of the &ldquo;Hey ho! Let&rsquo;s\ngo!&rdquo; punk song. The whole night you could tell he really wanted\nto cover something (other than just the &ldquo;James Bond Theme&rdquo; as\nusual) He ended with &ldquo;Feeling So Real&rdquo; just like last time, so I\nwas happy to say the least.</p>\n<p>Right now after the show Dan, Leighton, Chris and I are\ndrinking <a href=\"http://drinks.glowport.com/942.html\">virgin\nmargaritas</a> and listening to mellow jazz on <a href=\"http://streams.wgbh.org/wgbh/\">&lsquo;GBH</a>.

I've seen him before, with Bush in\nthe Campus Invasion tour in Norman, OK. This time around he was a\nlot funnier. He had a Krusty sticker from the Simpsons on his\nguitar. He also put on a wig and acted like a metal guy for a\nwhile. He was a lot more interesting this time around, even if he\ndidn't play \"All I Need Is To Be Loved\" or \"Oil 1\", two of my\nfavorite songs. He didn't jump on top of his keyboard or play a\nvery long guitar solo, but otherwise it was Moby at his best. The\nfirst encore he played was a quick cover of the \"Hey ho! Let's\ngo!\" punk song. The whole night you could tell he really wanted\nto cover something (other than just the \"James Bond Theme\" as\nusual) He ended with \"Feeling So Real\" just like last time, so I\nwas happy to say the least.</p>\n<p>Right now after the show Dan, Leighton, Chris and I are\ndrinking <a href=\"http://drinks.glowport.com/942.html\">virgin\nmargaritas</a> and listening to mellow jazz on <a href=\"http://streams.wgbh.org/wgbh/\">'GBH</a>. All and all a very\ngood day, although expensive for sure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"newsupdate\">\n<div class=\"updatedate\">August 5, 2002</div>\n<div class=\"updatetext\">The song Moby covered was <a href=\"http://w1.131.telia.com/~u13108580/ramonesmidis/blitzkrieg_bop.mid\">\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\"</a> by <a href=\"http://www.officialramones.com/\">The Ramones</a>.</div>\n</blockquote>\n",

At home, we didn't have Internet access, for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home.com\">@Home</a> hadn't updated our connection for our brand new cable modem yet. Instead we had to do real family-type things such as play the board game Omega Virus, which is very fun. After that I went to eat at IHOP with Kamaria and Josh and Josh's Kelsey. Too many people have the same name, and I always find it funny when they become \"owned\" like that for clarity.\n",

The only thing that surprised me was that they had much fewer soup options than they did salad ones. We then high-tailed it over to Jon&rsquo;s. Jesse and I performed an experiment. We both left at the same time from his house and took two different routes to get to Jon&rsquo;s. I took May, he took the Hefner Parkway. We tied. It didn&rsquo;t really help Jesse out like he had hoped. Tough luck. Then Jesse, Austin, Jon and I did something that I am sure will shock you all. We ate at the Edmond Whataburger.

She&rsquo;s only about 2 I think and she told me when I was banging the drums to &ldquo;stop making so many noises.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a little smartie! After that I headed over to Jesse&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s residence, where I watched Jesse&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s videos. A@ron does sketch comedy in a troupe at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oxy.edu\">Occidental College</a>, the &ldquo;Sketchy People.&rdquo; We then went to Jesse&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s residence to see what A@ron got Jesse for his graduation. It was a toilet. A@ron filmed Jesse and me as we sprayed it with a hose. For about 45 minutes. We also pretended like sticks were our arms and beat the toilet with them. And then this kid walked up with a Super Soaker, so Jesse made him squirt the toilet in the front yard. Oh yeah, and it was filled with red paint. After that we went to Casady&rsquo;s graduation. They have bagpipes instead of Pomp and Circumstance and a &ldquo;Senior speaker&rdquo; instead of a Valedictorian. At the fun reception thing afterwards, this girl came up to me. I remembered her from the Casady last-day-of-school party in which we had our picture taken for some reason. She told me that it was developed and came out well and then told me she&rsquo;d mail it to me and walked off. I don&rsquo;t know how she knows where I live, and I thought she didn&rsquo;t even have my last name. Creepy. After graduation, I went to Aimee&rsquo;s house. For those of you who are less informed, Aimee is the friend of Jackie, who is Jesse&rsquo;s girlfriend. I&rsquo;ve never really hung out with them before, and we had fun. We went to the coffeehouse by Galileo&rsquo;s and played 20 questions. The things we had to guess: Dennis Rodman, herniated disc, space shuttle Challenger, and big turtle. Stephanie came with her friend Cole and hung out for a little while. Then we went back to Aimee&rsquo;s and watched <i>The Way of the Gun</i> which is too complicated for my tastes. I then went home at 2:30am and ate my first food of the day except for a couple pieces of pizza. Ay caramba!</p>\n",
