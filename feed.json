It never happens.\n\n<blockquote>Incidentally, toll hikes were never contemplated in the original plan to build the Holland Tunnel, as tolls were to be rescinded after the initial costs of building the tunnel were recouped. But by the time this recoupment was close, PANYNJ had taken over the tunnel, and needed further financing for the construction of all the other Hudson River Crossings named after engineers (Goethels, Outerbridge) or presidents (Lincoln, Washington). PANYNJ is entirely non-profit, as it runs according to an interstate compact negotiated between New York and New Jersey. For PANYNJ to raise capital, it issues bonds, approved by the two states, which are backed by PANYNJ’s toll and rental income. Long story short, when PANYNJ needs financing, they raise tolls.</blockquote>\n<h2></h2>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Back in high school I discovered the music of <a href=\"http://virt.vgmix.com/\">Virt</a>, a video game musician who back then was using <a href=\"http://www.lim.com.au/ImpulseTracker/\">Impulse Tracker</a> to simulate the sound of the NES. Some of my favorites was his &#8220;Classical Favorites&#8221; tracks, available from his <a href=\"http://virt.vgmix.com/index.php?page=chip\">chiptunes</a> page, albeit in tracker formats.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, I was spending a lot of my own free time writing music with Impulse Tracker, so I dabbled a little bit in faking NES music, in my &#8220;LOFI&#8221; series, with some pleasing results. This was back around 2000 or so. I never quite got back into it, sadly.</p>\n\n<p>Later on, I discovered <a href=\"http://8bitpeoples.com/\">8bitpeoples</a>, a musical collective of chiptune artists. I went to their <a href=\"http://www.8bitpeoples.com/destroy/\">Data Destruction Tour</a> in Boston and got to talk to and admire the music of <a href=\"http://bit.shifter.net/\">Bit Shifter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nullsleep.com/\">Nullsleep</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.covox.net\">Covox</a>. I wrote a little bit about their music in a <a href=\"http://www.nullsleep.com/\">post for alwaysBETA</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway it&#8217;s been a couple years since then, and I&#8217;ve been excited to find out that Nullsleep, Bit Shifter, and crew are performing a showcase and debuting a documentary at this year&#8217;s <a href=\"http://2008.sxsw.com/\">SXSW</a> festivals here in Austin. Needless to say, I got pretty stoked.</p>\n\n<p>This revived my long-standing desire to get one of the handful of different Game Boy cartridges that people have made for writing chiptunes. The one I&#8217;d wanted for a long time is named <a href=\"http://nanoloop.de\">Nanoloop</a>, and I&#8217;m glad to say that I finally bit the builet and bought an original 1989 model Game Boy and the Nanoloop 1.3 cartridge!</p>\n\n<p>For my first song, I took one of my old LOFI tracks and spent a short amount of time trying to mock it up on the actual Game Boy, to see how close I had come to simulating the real sound.</p>\n\n<p>The results of this experiment are found in <a href=\"http://nertzy.com/media/lofi2.mp3\">LOFI2</a>. Compare with the original <a href=\"http://nertzy.com/media/lofi2_original.mp3\">LOFI2</a>, and please keep in mind that there are a lot more restrictions with using Nanoloop and a real Game Boy than I had in Impulse Tracker.</p>\n\n<p>After a couple days, I put forth a little bit more effort and wrote my first completely new Game Boy track, <a href=\"http://nertzy.com/media/goof_step.mp3\">Goof Step</a>. For this track, I kept things simple by only writing one pattern for each of the four available channels. I merely turn them on and off at strategic times to create the structure of the track. I&#8217;m pretty pleased with the results, and soon enough I will pursue a more ambitious and complete track.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Downloads:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://nertzy.com/media/lofi2.mp3\">LOFI2 (new version) - mp3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nertzy.com/media/lofi2_original.mp3\">LOFI2 (original version) - mp3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nertzy.com/media/goof_step.mp3\">Goof Step - mp3</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The plan was to drive the three hours, look through all the furniture I could, and get as much of what I need as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Now several of my friends have told me about IKEA, so I knew I was headed toward something a bit different.</p>\n\n<p>The drive to Houston was relatively uneventful. I listened to <a href=\"http://www.hibob.fm\">Bob FM</a>, singing along to Deep Blue Something&#8217;s &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s&#8221; and the song that reminds us, and Bill and Ted, that we are just &#8220;dust in the wind&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>I arrived and was instantly taken by the amusement-park-like parking lot. There were families all around loading up new furniture for the kids, young couples filling out their new shared homes, and a mish-mash of foreign languages.</p>\n\n<p>I walked inside hungry, so I immediately headed for the Café next to the Exit. The customer experience at IKEA is very well-defined beforehand, so it felt quite unnatural to go straight to the Exit Café. I wanted to get Swedish meatballs, as advertised, but couldn&#8217;t find them. I settled for two hot dogs and a Swedish pear soda.</p>\n\n<p>Unfazed, I set on my journey through the store. I brought in my laptop in hopes of finding a free wireless internet connection inside. I take whatever I can these days.</p>\n\n<p>But alas I found none, and realized I would get tired spending five hours lugging my new corporate behemoth 17&#8221; Macbook Pro on my back. So I quickly dashed through the preset IKEA path and out the exit, hoping no one would think I was trying to steal the tiny clipboard in my backpack that could have easily been found in the home organization section downstairs.</p>\n\n<p>Have once again ruined the pre-planned shopping experience, I set out to find a couch. A few hours later I was still weighing my options and had to move on for fear of running out of time.</p>\n\n<p>Perpetually clutching my little IKEA note card was my left hand, whose thumb began pulsating with a painful tightness. I dropped my things into my shopping bag and kept on, trying to help my hand relax.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually decided on a nice dark brown table and a matching bed with foam mattress. When I picked up the pieces I found they were out of dark brown bed frames so I snagged a medium brown last minute. I popped into the checkout line and grabbed a last-minute spot purchase five dollar welcome mat. Mission accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>Or rather, mission accepted, because little did I know what was still in store for me upon my fateful return.</p>\n\n<p>I spent half an hour trying to get twine properly tied around the furniture pieces on top of my car. My Boy Scout skills only got me so far and I asked for help, after most of the families and more frantic customers had been helped. The IKEA employee started to really wrap it up well as he noticed I had tied my car doors shut.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;You going to climb in through the window?&#8221; he half-jokingly suggested, and I made sure it was possible and said, &#8220;Sure, why not?&#8221; He proceeded to secure my goods firmly atop my Chevrolet Impala, and I stuffed myself into my car.</p>\n\n<p>As I often do, I checked for all of my belongings before I left. That&#8217;s when I realized I couldn&#8217;t find my wallet. Now, I had just used it to buy the very furniture that was blocking me from fully searching the interior of my car. I had already found all of the various pocket gizmos that I had haphazardly dumped onto my car floorboard. But still no wallet.</p>\n\n<p>Unfazed, I went back into the store and asked if anyone had found it. Alas, no one had. They promised to give me a call if it shows up, and try to arrange to ship it to Austin when and if it does.</p>\n\n<p>So, without any way to pay for things, I set off back to Austin. Right then I realized I didn&#8217;t have enough gas to go the whole way. Surely it will show up. Alternatively, I can wing something, I decided, and I was on my way.</p>\n\n<p>About an hour later, as I listened to two nerds on a radio show incessantly discuss computer games and the 25th anniversary of the IBM PC, a large bright streak shot through the sky in front of me. In a second, the light appeared, shot down at about a 30-degree angle with the ground, and exploded into many small bright bits, fading into nothingness.</p>\n\n<p>I halfway braced for an explosion, unsure if I had seen a meteor or a missile. Either way, if anything was left at impact it could have made quite a large blast. But instead, I only found silence. I immediately called my parents, who confirmed I had witnessed one of the <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/07aug_perseids.htm\">Perseids</a>. Here I was during the prime time of the meteor shower, driving late at night along desolate Texas countryside. The timing was just too perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I was alert, I kept on trucking. I spent a great deal of time trying to find a good station to listen to <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Matt Drudge</a>&#8217;s radio show. I constantly had to switch between five stations that I could barely pick up, all of which carried Drudge&#8217;s droning voice and characteristic long silences.</p>\n\n<p>As I neared the small town of Elgin, my fuel light came on. I needed to get some gas if I was going to make it the final 50 miles. I realized I had a stash of coins for use on toll roads, so I looked for a 24-hour gas station. Instead all I found were closed, dark convenience stores and their well-lit but credit-card-only gas pumps. No good without my wallet, which as yet hadn&#8217;t showed up.</p>\n\n<p>I pulled into an empty <a href=\"http://www.heb.com\">H.E.B. supermarket</a> parking lot and sized up my situation. A nice man wearing a U.S. Postal Service shirt pulled in to fill up his car, and I reluctantly asked him to help me.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Could you give me five dollars of gas?&#8221; I asked, explaining my situation. I played to his sympathies by adding that I was newly out of college and couldn&#8217;t even get in the doors of my car.</p>\n\n<p>I explained to him very nicely that if he put his credit card in the pump, he could pump about five dollars in himself, and I would be willing to pay him in change or mail him a check. He wasn&#8217;t biting, and rightfully so, considering the absurdity and my lack of ability to faithfully prove my car wasn&#8217;t stolen.</p>\n\n<p>He found this situation puzzling and tried his best to help. However, the best advice he could come up in his confusion was for me to take the pieces off of the top of my car and load them inside, which I think would be impossible and also not helpful.</p>\n\n<p>He pointed me down the road to the still-open Chevron station. It was now about a half hour past midnight.</p>\n\n<p>I waited until no one was looking, pulled up to the Chevron gas pump, then climbed out my window. Inside, I told the lady working there my entire situation and then handed her two Susan B. Anthony dollars, five quarters, five nickels, and four dimes, for a grand total of $3.90.</p>\n\n<p>Back outside (it was prepay) I filled up my car, as the worker lady stepped out for a smoke. I was pumping gas and this lady is <em>smoking</em>? Luckily my just over a gallon of gas did not take long and I got out of there. I predicted to myself that the fuel light would come on again as I pulled into my apartment complex.</p>\n\n<p>I got into Austin, ever eyeing my gas meter as it dwindled but held on. I was making good distance, and would make it!</p>\n\n<p>I got onto US Highway 183, and took the access road under Interstate 35. The construction was everywhere, and the plethora of completed and incomplete highway ramps made for an interesting scene. A few police cars had their lights on to signal the construction, as I had seen a few days earlier in the same spot after a wrong turn.</p>\n\n<p>But the Police were otherwise busy, I discovered. As the light finally turned green and I drove past, I watched as an officer guided a handcuffed man into the back seat of his cruiser. The timing of my drive by framed the shot just as any television drama might have.</p>\n\n<p>Still trapped in my car, hoping the doors were securely shut, and still unable to shut the windows enough to mute the loud highway noise, I pressed on. Finally I pulled into my apartment complex and watched as, surely enough, my fuel light turned on.</p>\n\n<p>I unloaded my car, refreshed that I could finally use its doors. But still, I found no wallet.</p>\n\n<p>I left my small cart that I used for the heavy pieces out on the apartment drive. As I was composing myself inside I heard a rattling outside and realized that someone was taking it. I ran outside, only to find my cart sitting in the hallway outside my neighbor&#8217;s door. No one was to be found.</p>\n\n<p>So I quickly nabbed the cart and brought it inside. I heard some people run down the stairs outside and decided to pop back out to explain the case of the mysterious disappearing cart, but once again they were nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n<p>So I went inside to cancel my credit cards.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily I had already lost my debit card last Thursday by leaving it in the drive-up ATM, so its replacement is on the way. Until then I will probably have to rely on writing checks and hoping people will take my expired passport as valid ID.</p>\n\n<p>I still need to get my Texas driver license, car title, inspection, and license plate. For new residents, there is a specific process one must follow, as everything depends on something else.</p>\n\n<p>But without my Oklahoma driver license, I probably cannot get my car inspected, and an un-inspected car cannot get its title paid, and an untitled car cannot be used to get a new Texas license, even ignoring the fact that my lack of my Oklahoma license will probably force me to take another driving test anyway. And last but not least, I won&#8217;t be able to get a Texas license plate to replace my Oklahoma plate, which expired at the beginning of the month.</p>\n\n<p>And on top of all this I&#8217;m switching over my auto insurance, which is why I waited to get my inspection in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I better not get pulled over, because I won&#8217;t have identification, a valid license plate, a license, or even an inspection sticker. Cross your fingers for me.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not really even a concern because I only have checks as a method of spending money, and I doubt I can get to a gas station that wouldn&#8217;t ask to see ID using only the sixteenth of a tank I have left. Needless to say, I hope my new ATM card comes in the mail by tomorrow morning. Not that I would know where to go anyway because I still have no internet access.</p>\n\n<p>But at least I still have my health!</p>\n\n<p>As long as you ignore the carpal tunnel attack.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This post may sound negative but really I am enjoying the absurdity of it all. I&#8217;m doing fine and should be able to get through all of this with only the required amount of elbow grease.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I just realized that in the course of a normal day I no longer have to deal with cathode ray tubes (CRTs).</p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend while relaxing in <a href=\"http://www.bransongrandplaza.com/\">my hotel</a> at my family reunion in Branson, Missouri, I found the worst CRT television set I had heard in quite a while. Every time I would change the channel, the set would emit a piercing high-pitched noise that my parents could not hear. My brothers and I felt tortured by it, especially my youngest brother Jon.</p>\n\n<p>At Olin, Prof. Gill Pratt taught me that the high pitches associated with CRTs are horribly annoying to young people but are impossible to hear in old age due to a lifetime of overexposure. But I think that may change in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>CRTs are not a wonderful technology. They have created a worldwide chemical disposal problem and they eat up energy in a wasteful large form factor made of shatter-vulnerable glass. But finally they have started to get replaced by better technologies like plasma, LCD, and organic LED (OLED) displays.</p>\n\n<p>Every day, the only displays I usually interact with my Apple monitor, Dell laptop, and my parents&#8217; new little HDTV, all of which are LCDs. Thus, I haven&#8217;t heard that infernal high-pitched whine in some time. Now I find that I have fewer headaches and often feel more relaxed.</p>\n\n<p>So my challenge to you is to find a CRT monitor in your life and consider transitioning it to a better technology. You just might make your life a little more pleasant.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>About a mile from my house one finds the Kilpatrick Turnpike. You might wonder who this toll road was named after. A successful inventor? An Olympic athlete? A war hero?</p>\n\n<p>At first I couldn&#8217;t find an answer, as the <a href=\"http://www.pikepass.com\">Oklahoma Turnpike Authority</a> doesn&#8217;t give any information on whom Oklahoma&#8217;s eight turnpikes are named after.</p>\n\n<p>What I did find there was that the turnpikes won&#8217;t be paid off until 2028. Better get used to paying those tolls! Also, the public&#8217;s debt is spread across all of the roads, so tolls won&#8217;t end on any of these roads until all eight are paid off. But then the poor turnpike officials would lose their jobs! We can&#8217;t have that! Oh well, all they have to do is construct yet another expensive highway to ensure that the tolls keep flowing.</p>\n\n<p>After that little realization I finally found the answer to my original question within <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/aaa276673cabc870?hl=en&amp;\">this 2002 USENET post</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>Kilpatrick Turnpike - named for OKC oilman and philathropist[sic] John Kilpatrick. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds pretty good, right? Until you realize that Kilpatrick was the director of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority around the time that the road was proposed. He named it after himself! Oh boy!</p>\n\n<p>Reading more into that post, I discovered that Turner Turnpike was named for former Oklahoma governor Roy J. Turner, whose claim to fame was establishing the turnpike system itself. And another major turnpike is named for H. E. Bailey, who among other things was, of course, a member of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority.</p>\n\n<p>I wish that when the roads are set up to perpetually take tolls from the people, that their names would at least recognize someone who might inspire the populace to do things other than set up more regulations, taxes, and tolls.</p>\n",

They also created <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.com\">Ruby on Rails</a>, the web framework that I&#8217;ve recently learned and actually made good use of recently, including on this <a href=\"http://www.typosphere.org\">Typo</a> blog.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, sorry to bore you with all of that technical mumbo-jumbo. Here is the comment I posted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI think that the competitive success of a good phone UI would be a watershed moment for interaction design. I feel like the general public would finally understand the idea that having lots of features is not what they want. Iâ€™m still shocked that none of the phone companies has stepped up and been bold enough to do it.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really do think this is true. All of the cell phone companies are running around with their heads cut off not giving anyone what they really need.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason my mom faithfully sticks to her old <a href=\"http://www.ieec.binghamton.edu/ieec/teardown/motorola_star_tac_cellular_phone.htm\">Motorola StarTac</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I spent a few hours today walking up and down Venice Beach and reminiscing on life. I&#8217;ve always preferred heat to cold and so I appreciated being out of the Boston weather. I doubt I will ever choose to live so far north again after I graduate.</p>\n\n<p>All of my friends out here are hired for jobs that last a few weeks, a month, or just a couple of days. My mom has also recently picked up this style of employment. Being raised by a salaried father, I realize I haven&#8217;t been exposed to the contract worker lifestyle, which is a lot different. Each week brings something new and the days off might be the weekend one week and weekdays the next. Not sure if I would prefer the randomness of this style or the regularity of a salaried Monday-Friday job.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, it&#8217;s looking like I&#8217;m headed toward the entrepreneur lifestyle, which seems to be some weird mix of the two. Each day during the day I ought to be expected to contribute some real value to the company, anywhere from product design to keeping on top of everything else that&#8217;s going on. But when something big hits outside of the normal hours, there&#8217;s still work that needs to be done, sometimes on really short notice.</p>\n\n<p>In a way, it&#8217;s a lot more work, but I love the diverse challenges, the freedom, and the do-it-yourself attitude, so I should be fine.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been checking out a lot of books from the library. I used to be quite a book person when I was young, especially in elementary school. Most of my fondest memories from when I lived in <a href=\"http://www.enid.org/\">Enid, Oklahoma</a>, and went to Hoover Elementary School involve me in the library reading a book on language or music or computers or something else that I&#8217;m still interested in today.</p>\n\n<p>At the time I had no idea that I was probably seeding ideas and thoughts that would recur throughout my entire education. The ideas that have come most readily to me over the years often involve pieces of my experiences from a few key times in my life in which I immersed myself in some sort of media, such as all of the digital stuff my friends and I toyed around with in high school.</p>\n\n<p>Reading all of these books lately has gotten me thinking about how I want to keep up after I leave Olin. With <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> to whet my tastebuds, I have found countless subjects that I want to learn more about, but each thing I find leads to three more. I&#8217;m a bit overwhelmed with the sheer amount of stuff I want to know about.</p>\n\n<p>I think once I graduate this May I will initially fill most of my newfound free time with books and music and perhaps some documentaries. Fiction doesn&#8217;t interest me much, so I will probably spend only just a little time with my Thomas Pynchon books.</p>\n\n<p>If I had all of the money in the world, I would buy music all day long. Of all of the songs I&#8217;ve heard, there are far too many by artists whose other music I have never heard.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can really portray how I feel about all of this stuff out there. I know that on her radio show Dr. Laura always says she doesn&#8217;t know how people can ever get bored with so many books in the world. I think that people get bored when they lack social stimulation, and books don&#8217;t really solve that. But I&#8217;m pretty happy with my social situation, so I feel I can heed her advice and dive in.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this certain depth at which I used to immerse myself into books that just cannot be duplicated on the Internet and in flashy video games, movies, and television shows. I think what has happened is that I&#8217;ve rediscovered it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I ushered for a play at Brandeis the other night. It was a comedy entitled <em>The Suicide</em>, being put on for Russian Week. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.xanga.com/p_OLIN_a\">Polina</a> for suggesting it. I really enjoyed making sure that everything went smoothly for the audience. It reminded me of the days when I was a roadie for my friends&#8217; band.</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.brandeis.edu/theater/season.html\">Brandeis theater schedule</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote> An unemployed man contemplates suicide but is besieged by spokespeople of discontented groups, from butchers to intellectuals, who want to turn his suicide into a gesture on their behalf. This brilliant Soviet-era satire is a classic of the Russian theater. </blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway we caught the final showing and it was pretty crazy. About halfway through so many things were going on at once and it was hard to figure out what the point of it all was. Experimental theater at its finest, I guess. Since it was the last performance, I think they added some crazy stuff like having a random lady walk out of this guy&#8217;s closet and lifting up the backdrop to reveal the backstage area.</p>\n\n<p>I talked with one of the other ushers, a graduate student who sat this play out for lack of enough parts to play. She explained the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method\">Suzuki Method</a> to me (although I feel like I might have gotten the name wrong after reading that Wikipedia entry). She&#8217;s going to be in Euripides&#8217;s <em>Bacchae</em> later this semester. I might go usher that as well to enrich the 1/4 of myself that is Greek. It&#8217;d be a good way to get out of Olin a little more.</p>\n",

My other websites are linked at <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/\">Grant Page Central</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I bet you&#8217;re wondering how I chose the name <em>Swimming in the Earth</em>.</p> <p>A couple weeks ago, I was in class here at <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu\">Olin College</a>. The class was SCOPE, our team-based yearlong engineering capstone project, and we had a guest speaker talking about ethics.</p>\n\n<p>To make a point about what words people associate with good ethics, the speaker asked, &#8220;When you die, what epitath would you want written on your gravestone?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Without skipping a beat, I thought to myself, &#8220;He swam in the earth.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>I was really taken aback by this random thought. I knew exactly what it meant to me, but as an image I&#8217;m not sure it fully conveys its point. Indeed, it invites the joke that my dead body would be &#8220;swimming&#8221; in the earth of the grave.</p>\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve gone off-topic.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming in the earth is my way of explaining the concept of living life to its fullest. This planet has a lot to offer me in the short time I have here. If I don&#8217;t break some rules and get my feet wet I&#8217;ll have missed out on a lot of experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, I should go swimming in the earth. Right through the dirt. Through the sky. Through the water too, but that&#8217;s too easy. I should run around and sit still. Get comfortable and catch myself off guard.</p>\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll be writing all about it here. Technology, humor, politics, language, music, society. Anything is fair game. Please leave this blog better than you found it; comments graciously welcomed.</p>\n",

Never mind that the bandwidth already gets paid for by the end users.</p>\n\n<p>The threat? Verizon will add a bottleneck to the connection, slowing down Google while letting other sites through at full speed. One might also notice that Verizon and Yahoo! <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Yahoo,+Verizon+launch+co-branded+DSL/2100-1034_3-5841915.html\">launched a co-branded DSL service</a> last August.

				"content_text": "I have spent the last few days with little social interaction.<br>\n<br>\nToday when my friend Mara came to my room I started blabbing about a\nmillion different things, because I had saved up stuff to talk\nabout.&nbsp; I must have appeared quite manic.&nbsp; She seemed OK with\nit though and manically spoke back so I guess it was fine.<br>\n<br>\nOver the course of the last two days I have decided that the world is starting to fall apart.&nbsp; Here is my evidence:<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>New Zealand, of all places, caught Israeli spies trying to\nfalsify their passports, and has starting cutting off a lot of the\ndiplomatic ties it has with Israel in response.</li>\n  <li>The police in Palestinian cities have been doing nothing lately,\nallowing anarchy to run rampant and leading to mob rule, as several of\nYasser Arafat's top deputies resign left and right.</li>\n  <li>The Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, informed all Jews in\nFrance that they \"must\" move to Israel to escape French anti-Semitism,\nwhich supposedly is on the rise.&nbsp; France is not happy with these\nstatements.</li>\n  <li>The 9/11 Commission is set to report that Iran was helpful to Al Qaeda prior to the September 11 attacks.</li>\n  <li>Iran has halted the trial of an Iranian intelligence agent who\nmurdered an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist, tearing apart whatever\ndiplomatic relations the two nations held.</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition, I have found myself reading all about Bobby Fischer,\nperhaps the world's best chess player ever, and certainly the chess\nworld's most outspoken anti-Semitic anti-American reclusive\nnutcase.&nbsp; Bobby Fischer praised the September 11 attacks on a\nPhilippines radio broadcast and went against a presidential order in\n1992 to play a chess game in Yugoslavia.&nbsp; He was found the other\nday at Narita International Airport in Japan and is in the process of\nbeing extradited to the United States to stand trial.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://home.att.ne.jp/moon/fischer/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">His website</a> is a hilarious mish-mash of misplaced criticisms and paranoid banter.<br>\n<br>\nBut they hauntingly reminded me of the website of a certain <a href=\"http://www.ishipress.com/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sam Sloan</a>.&nbsp; Here is a small list of similarities:<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>Both play chess incredibly well.</li>\n  <li>Both have plaintext websites with gobs of links as to why they have been persecuted by forces all over the world.</li>\n  <li>Both scan pictures of checks and all sorts of paper documents as evidence.</li>\n  <li>Both completely reprint news articles to support their causes.</li>\n  <li>Both attempt to completely libel individuals who they believe victimized them.</li>\n  <li>Both have spent time in East Asia fleeing some type of authority figure.<br>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nHowever, Sam Sloan is not a wanted criminal and is instead running for\nthe House of Representatives in the Bronx.&nbsp; He also is the last\nperson to have represented himself to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He won\nhis case 9-0.&nbsp; By the time the decision was rendered, it seems he\nwas in a prison in Afghanistan, which he escaped from soon thereafter.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway my current theory is that the \"savant syndrome\", which I am reading about in my book <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Phantoms of the Brain </span>by\nRamachandran, is at play.&nbsp; Both of these men are great chess\nminds,\nyet both seem horribly paranoid, constantly reinvent their lives, and\nproselytize their bizarre and specific views through verbose text-based\nwebsites.&nbsp; Socially I think their lives are completely complex\nmesses, and yet they maintain a careful constant determination to\nsucceed in whatever they do above all.<br>\n<br>\nSo, yeah, that's what I've been up to.<br>\n<br>\nOn Saturday, after a failed attempt by Tucker and Mara to get us\nShakespeare in the Park&nbsp; tickets, I wandered alone through the\nstreets of the Morningside Heights district of Manhattan, between 123rd\nand 110th Streets.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/40f9b6e5f8.jpg\" alt=\"Mailbox liquor\" title=\"mailbox_liquor.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /><br>\n<br style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><img src=\"uploads/2020/4a3ca0c727.jpg\" alt=\"123rd st park\" title=\"123rd_st_park.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /><br style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\n<br>\n</span>This view shows the red line of the subway as it becomes an\nelevated train.&nbsp;

I finished the final half of the Ramachandran book and read some of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing</span>,\nwhich I borrowed from my Biology (and Art) professor Helen\nDonis-Keller.&nbsp; This book ties right in with the Ramachandran book,\nexpanding on the cognition of seeing and applying it to the world of\nart.<br>\n<br>\nI am enrolled in a three student course with Prof. Donis-Keller for\nthis fall semester called The Intersection of Art and Science.&nbsp;\nPersonally, I cannot wait.&nbsp; I have always obsessed over the senses\nand the function of the brain, and the small size of the course means I\nwill get a good chance to explore with a lot of guidance from my\nprofessor.&nbsp; I often disagree with her, both politically and\nartistically at times, but appreciate her perspective because it often\ncatches me off guard and forces me to reconsider what I am doing.<br>\n<br>\nTomorrow I go bowling in Hoboken, New Jersey.&nbsp; Soon I will have an update for the <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/bowling.html\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grant Bowls!</a> page of my sister site <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grant Page Central</a>,\nwhich is in dire need of an update.&nbsp; My plan is to convert Grant\nPage Central into a static content site of my musical works, some\nwritings, and of course bowling scores, while letting this page, Grant\nPage X, be my blog.<br>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></span>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>What about last month?!</p>\n<p>OK so that last update didn’t say a whole lot. I know, I\nknow. Well here is an update on what's been going on in Grantland\nsince I talked to you last.</p>\n<p>I took the Mathematical Contest in Modeling with Kathy. The\nMCM is a mathematical modeling competition in which you get a few\ndays more than a weekend to research, create a mathematical\nmodel, and write a paper about some system. This year we did <a href=\"http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2003/problems/\">\nProblem A</a>, in which a motorcycle stuntman jumps over an\nelephant for a movie and lands in cardboard boxes. Our mission\nwas to describe how cardboard would cushion his fall, although I\nwould say our paper's strength was less in answering that\nquestion and more in considering a lot of different external\nfactors that other groups may not have considered. Like, for\ninstance, how to set up the shot so that it looks interesting in\na widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio frame.</p>\n<p>A week later was St. Valentine's Day and I started it off\nright by losing the ability to run Windows. I then ran off to <a href=\"http://www.needham.mec.edu/Hillside/\">Hillside\nElementary</a> and taught some fourth-graders about electricity\nand shocked them with a <a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/vdg.htm\">Van de Graaff\ngenerator</a>. Sometime I might go visit the <a href=\"https://www.mos.org/sln/toe/\">world's largest Van de\nGraaff</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.mos.org\">Boston Museum of\nScience</a>.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Van de Graaff generators, my current project for\nmy Project class is to build one. Que Anh, Sharon, Sutee, and I\nhave almost finished making a clear handheld Van de Graaff that\naims to make it more apparent to kids what is going on inside. It\nlooks really swanky. We ordered our <a href=\"http://www.waterscapesweb.com/orbs.html\">sphere</a> from a\n<a href=\"http://www.waterscapesweb.com/\">backyard/pool decoration\ncompany</a>, of all places, so ours looks the best in my\nopinion.</p>\n<p>Well anyway after all that mess it was time to go to the\nValentine dance. Beforehand my two dates, Clara and Janet, and I\nwent with Dan and Frances to a pretty good Italian restaurant, <a href=\"http://chefmoz.org/United_States/MA/Newton/Appetito954312216.html\">\nAppetito</a>, in <a href=\"http://www.teethwhitening-dentist.com/manewtoncenterteethwhitening.html\">\nNewton Center</a>. From there we returned to Olin and the dining\nhall where a multiple-story cardboard Eiffel Tower had been\nconstructed. The dance was somewhat fun and now Clara is my\ngirlfriend. You might be asking, “What about poor Janet,\nyour other date?” Well it turns out that now she is\nDan’s girlfriend, creating the odd situation where one pair\nof roommates is dating another pair of roommates. Strange.</p>\n<p>As if that wasn't enough, the next weekend I went to the <a href=\"http://www.econference.org\">2003 Stanford Graduate School\nof Business Entrepreneurship Conference</a> in Palo Alto, CA. We\nmade some good connections and hopefully I’ll be emailing\none of the graduate students I met that was helping to run the\nshow so that <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu\">Stanford</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.olin.edu\">Olin</a> can have some sort of\nofficalized relationship. This is the strange stuff that goes on\nwhen you attend a brand new college.</p>\n<p>Fast forward another weekend, and it’s once again time\nfor an Olin College Candidates Weekend. This year we held two\nweekends, each with about seventy-five students. I must admit I\nwasn’t so involved this time around. Candidate weekends are\nquite impressive. The concept is that you apply to Olin, and then\na certain number of students are invited to interview and\ninteract with the students, faculty, staff, and administration of\nOlin. Out of those who attend, the entire class is selected with\nno regard given to the test scores, essays, or anything in the\nsubmitted applications. In other words, the admission staff wants\nto meet everyone and make sure they are Olin material and also\nthat Olin is the right place for them. Candidate Weekend I ended\nwith the Franklin W. Olin Players performing “The\nForeigner”, which received a standing ovation. I wonder how\nmuch easier it is to get a standing ovation when your audience is\nfilled with candidates who <em>really</em> want to get in? The\nsecond weekend ended yesterday with ExpressO, which was an\nopen-mic talent show event culminating in a little\nmini-dance-party involving us, the faculty, prospective students,\ntheir parents, and the staff and adminstration. I don't know of\nany other school where this might happen.</p>\n",

Everything went well,\nalthough we stayed up until 5:00 finishing. We even ordered a\npizza at 2 in the morning from a place that offers baklava and\nmilkshake delivery as well.</p>\n<p>We watched the entire movie <span class=\"italictitle\">Backdraft</span> between the first and second\nshots of the day, thus creating the new unit of time, the\nbackdraft, equal to 132 minutes. We spent 7.5 backdrafts filming.\nYou do the math.</p>\n<p>I shot two hours of behind-the-scenes video footage and took\nabout three hundred photos, which I just uploaded to my computer.\nNeedless to say this was a well-documented venture.</p>\n<p>The day after shooting, Jon, Austin, Lauren, Jesse, Farah, and\nI ate at the Chuck House, the best place to get a Chicken Fried\nSteak Dinner for about five dollars. Yes, five dollars. You know\nit’s quality when you have to order over a telephone at\nyour table. For some reason, Jesse's phone was wired to the\n<acronym title=\"public address\">PA</acronym> system. Farah played\nsome early electronic music for me in the car and after we saw\nher off, the rest of us waited about thirty minutes in a\nWalgreen’s parking lot as Jesse complained to the managers\nand whoever about the scratched negatives on his pictures.</p>\n<p>After that I had dinner with Stephanie at Ted’s\nCafé Escondido, <em>the</em> best place to eat in Oklahoma\nCity. This ’hidden cafe” has the best Mexican food\nyou can find, which would blow the minds of the New England types\nI’m consistently surrounded by.

				"content_text": "<p>Monkey ball</p>\n<p>These two words have dominated the previous week. As Jon was\nout of town, the gang and I have found it necessary to find new\nplaces to hang out. Monkey Ball and Monkey Ball 2, both by <a href=\"http://www.sega.com\">SEGA</a> and for the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com\">Nintendo</a> GameCube, have been\ncrowd favorites. Anyone who’s buying any GameCube games\nanytime soon, get three for the price of two over at Amazon using\n<a href=\"http://www.fatwallet.com/redirect/bounce.php?fwcodeid=25121\">\nthis coupon</a>. Just thought you should know.</p>\n<p>Well Christmas happened. If you ask <a href=\"http://members.cox.net/austn3\">Austin</a>, and I know you\nwill, there were <em>two</em> christmases. “Christmas\n2” was at Jesse's dad's house. And yes, they are Jewish, so\nit really wasn't Christmas at all, but this is Austin we're\ntalking about. Anyway, Austin, Jiongyi, and I ate an\neighteen-pound turkey over there (not seventeen-pound as earlier\nadvertised). A@ron, Jesse’s brother, continually called\nJiongyi “TC”, since he only ever knew of TC. Anyway\neventually a ton of gravy spilled onto Jesse and, well, that\nchanged the course of dinner substantially. Check out the picture\nfrom Austin’s site, <a href=\"http://members.cox.net/austn3/andthen.html\">“and\nthen...”</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than that we held a more traditional Christmas at my\nhouse this year, albeit traditional doesn’t describe this\none well. My cousin Nick played guitar, my brother Jon or I would\nplay bass guitar, and my brother Kyle or I would play drums as\nNick, my mother, or at one point a good portion of my aunts would\nsing the lyrics to Nirvana’s “In Bloom”. Yes,\nreally. On Christmas.</p>\n<p>If you want to be all superficial about Christmas, I got\nclothes and money. For once I realize that these are really what\nI want.</p>\n<p>My life is slowly being sucked away by Linux. I have been\noptimizing my <a href=\"https://www.gentoo.org\">Gentoo Linux</a>\ninstallation a lot over the last few days. Gentoo is wonderful. I\ncompiled everything, starting with the compiler, so I know each\nprogram is fully optimized for my system. Also, installation is a\nbreeze since I only need type <code>emerge\n&lt;progname&gt;</code> in order to install anything. Once I can\nfind a way to update my web site in Linux, there will be a lot\nmore updates to this site.</p>\n<p>Last night we played poker to celebrate Jon’s return\nfrom Seattle. Everyone was there and we started out with 5 draw\nand 7 stud. After a while we tired of throwing around so many\ncards and instead settled on <a href=\"http://www.holdempoker.com/texasholdemrules.html\">Texas\nHold’em</a>. I highly suggest Texas Hold’em as a more\npleasurable poker experience.</p>\n<p>I’m going to make a DJ mix. I think I might burn it to a\nCD. I might even give out a few copies. I don’t know.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Oklahoma in 2 days</p>\n<p>I poked around on the Internet a lot these last few days of\nfreshman semester I. The first oddity I came across was <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com\">Splorp</a>. I have been thinking of\ndoing an independent study / passionate pursuit (as\nwe call them) on typography. Essentially I’ve been\nconsidering designing my own font and getting some side credit\nfor it. Well after casually browsing I found this Splorp site\nwhich is a blog of a certain Grant Hutchinson. Grant Hutchinson\nwho has made fonts and is interested in several things I am also\ninterested in. Grant Hutchinson who <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com/about/\">brags</a> that he is number\none when you search for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Grant+Hutchinson%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search\">\n“Grant Hutchinson”</a> on Google. It so turns out\nthat I am the number one result for the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Grant+Hutchins%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search\">\n“Grant Hutchins”</a> search on Google. Needless to\nsay he will be receiving an email in his inbox shortly relating\nto this matter.</p>\n<p>The scary thing is that this isn’t the first time\nI’ve run into this strange <a href=\"http://webhome.idirect.com/~donlong/monsters/Html/Doppelga.htm\">\ndoppelganger</a> phenomenon. A few years back when I was\nconsidering becoming a Japanese translator, I found a Grant\nHutchins who lives in Oregon and is a Japanese translator.\nNeedless to say I feel less unique when I find these people.</p>\n<p>Another oddity I’ve found is this shoddy <a href=\"http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs2002b/Welcome_Opening_Page.htm\">\ncollege report on medieval British literature</a> that stole the\nimage of Olin’s campus. Why did this person decide to steal\nan image from our website and reassign the Academic Center as a\n<a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/English/Beowulf/eBeowulf/guide.htm\">\nBeowulf</a> museum? Since when is the Campus Center a shrine to\n<a href=\"http://www.pathguy.com/kinglear.htm\">King Lear</a>? And\nthe Olin Center as an archive of information on <a href=\"http://www.camelotthemepark.co.uk/\">Arthurian Legend</a>?\nLaughable at best!</p>\n<p>Other than that I’ve just been sticking to pages like <a href=\"http://www.sharpeworld.com\">Sharpeworld</a> and <a href=\"http://www.coudal.com\">Coudal Partners</a> for wasting\ntime. The links here are marvelous. I’ve also been visiting\n<a href=\"http://www.plep.org\">Plep</a> a little bit, but not as\nmuch as much of the content isn’t personally that\ninteresting to me. One recent favorite is the <a href=\"http://death.oracion.co.jp/parkanimal/index.htm\">Japanese\npark animals gallery</a>.</p>\n<p>Back in reality I’m finishing up my finals. <a href=\"http://mywebpages.comcast.net/billh333/auditron.htm\">All I\nhave left</a> is my Differential Equations exam.</p>\n<p>Somehow I busted up my laptop.

				"content_text": "<p>Where to start?</p>\n<p>Yesterday I went to the <a href=\"http://www.wbcn.com/wbcn_com_xmasrave_files/paradise.htm\">WBCN\nXmas Rave</a> <a href=\"http://www.moby.com\">Moby</a> show at the\n<a href=\"http://boston.cc.com/paradise.asp\">Paradise Rock\nClub</a> in Boston, MA. He billed it as a show in which he will\nbe playing older songs in his journal. I was quite excited to get\nto hear some of the earlier more electronic songs. I found that\nthis really wasn’t the case, however. The only old songs he\nplayed that he usually wouldn’t were “That’s\nWhen I Reach For My Revolver” and “Next is the\nE”. After playing a couple songs, he came out and said,\n“We have a goal for tonight. We’re going to play the\nlongest show we ever have,” which was met by much applause.\nI was quite close to the stage. So close, in fact, that Moby\nhimself stepped on my hand. I was right in front of two of the\nsubwoofers and essentially leaning on them as Moby would jump up\non it and play his guitar in such a manner that I would have to\nlook directly up to see him. I was jumping up and down a lot, and\nhad to watch the height so I wouldn’t bump into his…\ncrotch. He stepped on my hand at one point and might have been\npointing to me as I was jumping. Anyway Dan and I had a lot of\nfun. Dan was especially happy when Moby left and came back in a\ncheaply made shirt with iron-on letters that spell “COVER\nBAND”. Moby covered about ten of Dan’s favorite\nclassic rock songs, some in different styles. Read about it on my\nnew <a href=\"concerts.html\">concerts</a> page.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after the show Dan and I waited around with the hope\nthat Moby would come out and meet us or that something else\ninteresting would happen. While waiting around I noticed that\nMoby’s beloved carrot juice was sitting on stage. I\nwondered if they would give it to us if we asked, half-jokingly.\nDan pulled a roadie aside and said “Hey will you give us\nthat carrot juice? It was his birthday,” to which the man\nresponded, “You really want his <em>backwashed</em> carrot\njuice?!” Needless to say we received said carrot juice,\nwhich is now sitting in my room. It’s in a <a href=\"http://www.dasani.com\">Dasani</a> bottle.</p>\n<p>This morning I checked Moby’s online journal to see if\nhe had mentioned the idiotic jumping fan in front of him at the\nshow or the fact that his carrot juice was missing, and instead I\nlearned that after the show he had been attacked by three\n“preppy” men “with mace” who punched him\nin the face for no apparent reason. This comes as quite a shock,\nbut Moby is not mad and did not fight back. Such is his\nstyle.</p>\n<p>Just a few minutes ago I learned that the lead\nsinger / Moog player / trombonist for\n<a href=\"http://www.stereolab.co.uk\">Stereolab</a>, Mary Hansen,\nhas <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/12/mroom.stereolab/\">\ndied in a freak bicycle accident</a>. I am glad that Stereolab\ngot to reason as much music as they did, something like an album\na year for a full decade. I am quite impressed by their wide\nassortment, and have several of their limited edition vinyl\nsingles. Every single they release comes in limited edition\nversions. I had the fortune to attend their recent show in Boston\nat the <a href=\"http://avalon.billcrook.com/\">Avalon</a>, one of\nthe only shows that resulted in a <em>double</em> encore. I read\na funny <a href=\"http://www.koly.com/stereolab/reviews/review.php?sid=85\">review</a>\nof this show once, calling mine the “lamest crowd”\never for Stereolab. I thought it was quite laid back, and this\nreviewer thought it was rowdy. This shows the disparity between\nthe shows the two of us are used to.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"newsupdate\">\n<div class=\"updatedate\">December 13, 2002</div>\n<div class=\"updatetext\">Actually, Mary Hansen was the\nvocalist /  guitarist.

				"content_text": "<p>No more teenagehood.</p>\n<p>My twentieth birthday was yesterday. It was one of the busier\ndays I’ve had in a while, but it was nice that a few people\ndid something for me! First at the Math Table showing of <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119217\">Good Will Hunting</a>,\nProf. Sarah Spence brought some cupcakes and even some salsa and\nchips. Much appreciated! After that I retired to my room around\n11:30 p.m. and discovered that my bed was covered with balloons.\nThere was a jar of silly string sitting next to my bed, and no\none to be found anywhere. I wandered down the hall and ran into\nNicole and Kathleen realizing they had missed their chance to\nsurprise me. They had been waiting in my room for over an hour\nand went to look for me. Dan had no idea and was in the other\nroom.</p>\n<p>I went <a href=\"bowling.html\">bowling</a> the other day at <a href=\"http://www.lanesgames.com\">Lanes and Games</a>. I have been\nimproving considerably lately. The second of two games resulted\nin a tie of my personal record. With just 100 in the 8th frame, I\nhit a strike on the 9th, strike on the 10th, third strike to make\nperhaps my first turkey in my life, and then rounded it out with\nseven more to make 157. I didn’t get the Ms. Pac-Man high\nscore, however.</p>\n<p>My cohort project course has completed. I feel that we could\nhave done better on our design, but we did find a good amount of\nsuccess. Our crowning achievement is that we spent only 6.5% of\nour budget. One of our goals at the outset was to set an example\nfor thriftiness.</p>\n<p>Similarly, all my other classes are winding to a close. A week\nfrom Thursday I’ll be flying back to Oklahoma for a full\nmonth. Not a full-month flight, but a full-month vacation. I just\nrealized that I used “winding down” to describe my\nclasses in the last post. I’m not very creative lately\nafter all!</p>\n<p>I was perusing the <a href=\"http://www.coudal.com/\">Coudal\nPartners</a> website the other day and wandered onto the <a href=\"http://www.coudal.com/tennisarc.php\">Photoshop Tennis</a>\ncompetitions. The idea is that two designers representing\ndifferent design groups send Photoshop “volleys” back\nand forth (spending approx. 30 mins–2 hours per volley) and\nthen editing what comes back. The evolution of these graphics is\nquite interesting and often unexpected. One of my favorites is\nthe transition from <a href=\"http://www.coudal.com/tennis/-temp01.php?matchid=011109_pray&amp;volley=07\">\nthis</a> to <a href=\"http://www.coudal.com/tennis/-temp01.php?matchid=011109_pray&amp;volley=08\">\nthis</a>. Anyway, I’ve challenged <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/jfernandez\">Jesus Fernandez</a> to\na little sparring match. Watch for this sometime soon.</p>\n<p>The other day I became very interested in <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/eddanamta/abandoned/abanstas.html\">abandoned\nsubway tunnels, tracks, and stations</a> in the Boston area. I\nhave been learning about parts of the <a href=\"http://www.mbta.com/traveling_t/schedules_subway.asp\">MBTA\n“T” subway system</a> are no longer running,\nincluding an <a href=\"http://www.nycsubway.org/us/boston/orange/\">elevated train\ncalled the “El”</a> that used to run near Washington\nAve up until the 1980s. It is being replaced by the new <a href=\"http://www.allaboutsilverline.com/\">Silver Line</a>. Anyway\nit makes me want to go visit an abandoned train station, although\nthat would probably be a very bad idea.</p>\n",

This should prove to be a good show,\nbecause Moby <a href=\"http://www.moby.com/cms/viewdiary.asp?Diary_ID=1097&amp;ViewType=Current\">\nmentioned in his online journal</a> that he is going to play his\nolder more electronic songs. He’ll also have been off tour\nfor a week at home in New York City, so he should be even more\nenergetic than ever. Moby is also not only the headliner, but the\n<em>only</em> act playing. This means he will get all sorts of\ntime to try new things and wow the crowd. Plus, the Paradise is\nsuch a cozy venue, where it’s literally impossible to stand\nmore than about 30 feet from the stage. The show was sold out\nright after I decided to go, so I perused <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com\">eBay</a> for <a href=\"http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&amp;krd=1&amp;from=R8&amp;MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;SortProperty=MetaEndSort&amp;query=Moby+Boston\">\npeople reselling tickets</a>.

I literally watched it\nget marked down from 30% to 40% off. That’s like 40 bucks\nless. My brothers and I are going to form a band and try to\nrecord some music over Christmas break. Jon plays bass and\n(increasingly) guitar, while Kyle plays drums.</p>\n<p>I’ve been sleeping a lot lately. My naps are dominating\nmy days now. I’ve got to learn to stay awake.</p>\n<p>My mom enters a lot of contests (or “sweeps”, if\nyou’re so inclined). She wins about four or five contests a\nmonth now!

I\nguess they let anyone request it and put their grimy paws on it.\nSomeone’s grimy paws were sticky this time.</p>\n<p>I’ve had the busiest weekend imaginable! It all started\nFriday (as weekends usually do) when I left with Nicole, Jesus,\nand (note the change in roster) Kori Haymore, one of the new\nstudents. We went to the <a href=\"http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/\">\nIpswich River Wildlife Sanctuary</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.massaudubon.org/\">Massachusetts Audubon\nSociety</a>. It was very nice. We stayed in the Innermost Cabin,\nwhich was barely enough to fit four people and a Franklin stove.\nWe walked around a bit and then sat by the fire and kerosene\nlamps reading the journal entries from previous guests. Of\nparticular interest were the horror stories by various\neleven-year-old children. My favorite was “Werewolf\nMan” although “Pigmonkeyman” was also a\nfavorite. I’ll post fulltext up here soon.</p>\n<p>The next morning I got back from Ipswich with less than 15\nminutes to go before once again leaving to go to the only proper\nbowling alley in all Boston. It turns out that New England has\nits own special type of bowling called Candlepin Bowling that\nseems inferior. The balls are smaller and the pins are simple\ncylinders. Hardly engaging! Anyway I got my best three game\nseries in my life. I’m launching a <a href=\"bowling.html\">new section of my page</a> devoted to bowling\nscores. This may sound odd, but I’ve wanted to do this for\nabout five years now. I got 137, 128 and 149. 149 was the best\ngame of the night and my second best score ever, although the\nbest average score goes to Emma Goodman, an IMSA girl from the\ngreat bowling state of Illinois. The last game was quite eventful\nin that I hit the first 50 pins down without a slip. Four spares\nand one strike.</p>\n<p>Later that night back at Olin we held a Dead or Alive 3\ntournament in the Dining Hall on the big projected screen. The\nscene was quite impressive, quite larger than life. I’m not\na big fan of 3D fighting games or the X-Box in general so I\nmerely spectated. Afterwards I felt nostalgic so I downloaded\nMAME in order to play Galaga. Well worth my trouble.</p>\n<p>The next morning I woke up to attend a five-hour session on\nthe traditional Japanese board game Go. I am starting to enjoy it\nmore and perhaps I will get better at it. It is perhaps the most\ncomplicated game I know and there’s no chance for me (or\nany human or even a computer) to ever master the game. The best\nGo-playing computers can’t beat twelve-year-olds. Go was\nheavily featured in the movie <a href=\"http://www.pithemovie.com\">Pi: Faith in Chaos</a> which is\ncoincidentally my favorite movie.</p>\n<p>Right after that I took my take-home physics final in what\nwould turn out to be the only three-hour patch of free time for\nthe weekend. Keep in mind it’s already Sunday by this\npoint. I had to hurry up and finish the exam (which I felt I did\nquite well on, even though there were many little details to\nconsider).</p>\n<p>I really wanted to go to the local <a href=\"http://www.marsmusic.com\">Mars Music</a> store because they\nare going out of business nationwide. Everything must go! Prices\nmarked down 20-40%! That means a lot for musical equipment! That\ncan make or break so many potential sales! My mom and I were\ntalking about buying an electric guitar so that we can complete\nthe newest boy band craze at home, Hutchins. Hutchins is like\nHanson except instead of being from Tulsa, OK, we are from\nEdmond, OK. No difference. Except shorter hair. Anyway it turns\nout that both locations near me were in the list of four stores\nnationwide that have already closed, so I didn’t get to go\nrun around crazily and pick out items like candy. Oh, bother.</p>\n<p>The weekend ended on a wonderful note when I went with <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/sheeva/www/\">Sheeva</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.fountainsofwayne.com\">Fountains of Wayne</a>\nconcert. It was at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston on Comm Ave.\nThis venue is great! I highly recommend it! The place is so small\nand cozy and right when I walked into the auditorium I found\nmyself right in the center only 6 or 7 people back. I stayed\nthere and danced with Sheeva the whole time, often to an extent\nmuch greater than that of the considerably older populace about\nus. While there I bumped into Que Anh and Erin McCusker, both of\nwhom had accompanied Alex Valdivia. This means that 7.5% of our\nschool was there. I got there an hour after doors opened and I\ncompletely missed the first act, OKGo. I should have known Que\nAnh would come since she is obsessed with them. The show ended\nrelatively early but started relatively early as well. I knew\nevery song except for the ones that are on the new album. The\nverdict on the new material? Fountains of Wayne are coming back\nfor more in their third release due out this spring, moving in a\nmore experimental direction while continuing to capture the\nfamiliar catchiness and heart of their earlier work. By the way,\nnothing beats the final piano of “Leave the Biker”.\nIt sent shivers down my spine. After the second (!) encore I\ngrabbed a nice brown shirt that says simply “FoW” and\ngot back home with a good amount of time to goof around and then\nget a good night of sleep.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I am also sick and this last weekend was met\nwith much coughing. I’ve vowed to slow down my plans this\nweek and let this finally subside.</p>\n",

I am currently\nbrainstorming some project ideas, including one that might\ninvolve developing a product with Jay Gantz to possibly try to\nget to market. Depends on how ambitious I’m feeling. We\nhave a good idea that might be profitable, or might not even be\npossible. We’re through with calculus in my Mathematical\nFoundations in Engineering I course, so now we’re starting\nDifferential Equations. I am quite happy for that, as I\nhaven’t really had any new math for three years now.</p>\n<p>Dan Frey, the Professor for our Project class, recently\ndecided to leave Olin and go to MIT to head a high-profile design\nclass that involves robots and some sort of competitive edge.

Every song\nI’ve ever heard from them sticks in my head and I know all\nthe lyrics even though I don’t try.</p>\n<p>Also, today Nicole invited me to go with Jesus and Kathleen to\na cabin in Ipswich for Friday night. I think it should be fun.\nI’ve never been to Ipswich and frankly I’m not sure\nwhere it is. It’s an hour away.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"newsupdate\">\n<div class=\"updatedate\">November 11, 2002</div>\n<div class=\"updatetext\">But Kathleen was busy so Kori ended up\ncoming instead. Why is this important? I have this strange\nobsession with who is with me and where they are situated in\nrelation to me. I often have dreams where I can only remember\nsitting with a group of people at a table. I remember where each\nperson sat and somehow it seems quite important to me. Just one\nof those things.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, I am quite busy this weekend and I’ll\nget a Physics test tomorrow that’s due Monday. I hopefully\nwill get it done tomorrow night. Then there’s the Calculus\ntest I get tomorrow as well, but isn’t due until Wednesday.\nIt all compounds.</p>\n",

From the (old) <acronym title=\"Electrical and Computer Engineering\">ECE</acronym> Lab to\nthe (fake) <acronym title=\"Information Technology\">IT</acronym>\nroom on the (real) campus, I ran around with the <a href=\"http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/bill/linus/linus-posse.png\">\nLinux Posse</a>. The Linux Posse is Gill, Brian, Ben, and I. We\nstormed on into <acronym title=\"Information Technology\">IT</acronym> and told them how to\npartition the machines. We were quite the <a href=\"http://www.videovigilante.com\">vigilantes</a>, I must say.\nI also met Aaron, the new Linux/Unix admin. Well anyway we had\ntrouble figuring out how to do it, so I gave up and left.</p>\n<p>While I was up there, I helped Adam and Rod move Jesus and\nAdam's big table to its final resting place. The table is filled\nwith memorabilia from last year. Jesus joking said he could make\nanything (including a <a href=\"http://www.speakeasy.org/~ecf/coffee.html\">coffeetable</a>)\nfor his art project last year. Well, it <a href=\"http://www.jokeaday.com/7aolexe.shtml\">morphed quickly from\na joke to actuality</a>, and it's a beauty. <a href=\"http://projects.olin.edu/marsport\">The History and Mystery\nof Mars</a> - Episode 4 is on there, as is the tiny vase Adina\ngave me before she had to return to <a href=\"http://www.oradea.ro/\">Transylvania</a>.</p>\n<p>I saw the first new students arriving today, Ben Bloom and\nMikell Taylor. There will be a large flood of people coming in\ntomorrow. Joy! Both the emotion, and the Olin <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu\">student</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm going camping! The Olin <a href=\"http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~comp/\">Outing Club</a> is going\nto stay the night up on the <a href=\"http://thesaltysailor.com/april.htm\">border between New\nHampshire and Maine</a>. Afterwards will be a hike up some\nmountain, which I may or may not do, considering my strange\nshallow breath syndrome.</p>\n<p>Cough, cough.</p>\n<p>I packed a ton of stuff today. Tomorrow I'll finish up the\nlittle things, and the next day I'm out of temporary housing once\nand for all!</p>\n",

It all started simply enough, with\nyet another day of toying around with <acronym title=\"operational amplifiers\">op-amps</acronym> and such. Then\nSara barged in and abducted me from Ben.</p>\n<p>We went to get the <a href=\"http://unicorn.olin.edu/wiki/wiki/moin.cgi/OlinHonorCode\">Olin\nHonor Code</a> back from the framing company. The framing company\non the way to <a href=\"http://www.lifescience.co.jp/framingham/framingham.htm\">Framingham</a>,\nthat is. We got there and had to <a href=\"http://www.merkury.com/color.html\">pick out a blue</a> for\nthe matte. The workers very visibly wanted to slack off, so we\nran off to <a href=\"http://www.wendys.com\">Wendy's</a> and both\nhad Spicy Chicken Sandwiches.</p>\n<p>As we were leaving, there was a guy who drove by with the\nletters <acronym title=\"Whip Out Wednesdays\">WOW</acronym> who\nheld up a card that said \"<acronym title=\"Whip Out Wednesday\">WOW</acronym>\" to Sara. It stands for\n\"Whip Out Wednesdays\". It's from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40683-2002Aug20.html\">\nOpie and Anthony</a> radio show, which seems to be drivel.\nEssentially when a girl sees this on a <a href=\"http://www.wcg.org/lit/jesus/threedays.htm\">Wednesday</a>,\nshe's supposed to flash the guy back. Yeah, that'll be\n<em>really</em> successful.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=40852\">Wendy's</a>,\nwe picked up the Honor Code, along with the wrong frame for the\n[secret Orientation 2002 activity deleted]. I got to deliver the\nHonor Code to the new campus and see the Campus Center again.</p>\n<p>Bret, Alex, and Julie are now here. Along with Susan, they've\nmoved to the real residence hall. They are this year's <acronym title=\"Residence R-somethings (I forget)\">R2's</acronym>. I never\nthought I'd see the day when <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/\">Olin students</a> would live in\nreal buildings.</p>\n<p>After work, I was instantly pulled along to go eat at the <a href=\"http://www.closetelvis.com/Editorials/Marcelo/cheesecake.htm\">\nCheesecake Factory</a>. Only, it didn't work out. The wait for\nour unannounced group of fourteen would have been a couple hours,\nso we instead went to <a href=\"http://www.abruzzoitalico.it/intro/deaqua/en/elisir.asp?ID=17&amp;sez=elisir\">\nPapa Razzi</a> across the street. Yes, two words. Anyway I highly\nsuggest it. The food was great and they worked very hard to seat\nus within about 20 minutes. Plus I got to have garlic!</p>\n<p>Mmm, garlic. It's <a href=\"http://www.garlicvalleyfarms.com/nutrition.html\">healthy</a>\nfor you, you know.</p>\n<p>After that I packed a lot of stuff. It's going to take a lot\nof boxes, as my room is filled with tons of crap. The hardest\npart is pretty much out of the way, though.</p>\n<p>Have you heard the song from the new artist Mario? Yes, \"<a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456031/20020711/mario.jhtml\">\nJust a Friend 2002</a>\". Well I don't like it! They took <a href=\"http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/audio/detail.asp?ID=1218\">a\nwonderful Biz Markie song</a> and did a cover. Well, it's not so\nmuch of a cover as taking the chorus from a humorous sarcastic\nsong and making it into a sappy R&amp;B tune. I must say I am\nappalled. The original is one of those few videos I remember\nwatching and loving from MTV back around 1989 when I first\ndiscovered music videos. It's right up there with <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/MissOOhna/deeelite.html\">Deee-Lite</a>'s\n\"<a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/groovekittie99/\">Groove is in\nthe Heart</a>\" (which I have on vinyl, no less). <a href=\"http://www.towatei.com\"><acronym title=\"Disc Jockey\">DJ</acronym> Towa Tei</a> is the coolest! The\nlead singer, <a href=\"http://www.ladykier.com\">Lady Miss\nKier</a>, is now a <acronym title=\"Disc Jockey\">DJ</acronym> as\nwell. So that, along with <a href=\"http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/supadjdmitry-screams.html\">\nSupa <acronym title=\"Disc Jockey\">DJ</acronym> Dmitry</a>, makes\nevery member of the band an active <acronym title=\"Disc Jockey\">DJ</acronym> right now.</p>\n<p>Astronomical!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h3 class=\"newsdate\">Tuesday, August 20, 2002</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you just gotta let the nerd out of yourself.</p>\n<p>I generally try to adopt a nerd-free attitude on life, but\ntoday was an unusual situtation. I started by wearing my <acronym title=\"Random Access Memory\">RAM</acronym> necklace that Gary\nmade for me back in <a href=\"http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/PA_env-Her/history_1681_1945/molliemaguires.htm\">\nMr. Gowen</a>'s class.</p>\n<p>Later in the day, while I was marking up the C tutorial into\n<a href=\"https://validator.w3.org\">validating</a> <acronym title=\"Hypertext Markup Language\">HTML</acronym>, just as a nerd\nmight do, <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/smunson/\">Sean</a>\npulled me aside with a few people to take a picture for the new\nOlin Library website. Like the nerd I am, I picked up <a href=\"https://www.2600.com\">2600</a> and started reading it for\nthe picture.</p>\n<p>The plot really thickened when yesterday's plan worked out.\nOlin made <a href=\"https://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/20/173240&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=146\">\nSlashdot</a>!!! It really killed our <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu\">website</a>. Traffic halted to a\nstand-still. I was pretty happy with the hundreds of comments\nthat came pouring in after the article got posted. Sean and I\nfrantically worked to dispel rumors and generally share our\nexperiences with the <a href=\"https://slashdot.org\">Slashdot\ncommunity</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/ghutchins\">Grant\nPage Central</a> was the recipient of <a href=\"https://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=38359&amp;cid=4107494\">direct\nattacks</a>! I must say I find it highly entertaining. Maybe I\nshouldn't have <a href=\"http://www.iphc.org/docs/solemn/pride.html\">glorified this\nflame with a response</a>, but I had a lot to say. Hopefully I\nwas <a href=\"http://www.camsp.com/keypoint/survey_resources/survey_library/product_service/isp_quality/webform.htm\">\nfairly professional</a> about it.</p>\n<p>Also, some <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu\"><acronym title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">MIT</acronym></a>\nstudents want to throw a party with us now that they discovered\nus on Slashdot. I know it's scary to imagine making social\nconnections with <acronym title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">MIT</acronym>\nthrough Slashdot, but I still think it has a good chance of\nworking out! (<a href=\"http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/hackers/25.html\">NERD\nALERT!</a>)</p>\n<p>In other news, <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/sschwalbenberg\">Sara</a> and I ate\nat <a href=\"http://www.pacinis.com/Needham.htm\">Pacini's</a>\ntoday. We both had the lasagna. Very cool.</p>\n<p>I saw <a href=\"http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com\">Tucker</a> for the\nlast time today. He's off to New York and <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu\">Columbia University</a> on Sunday;\nuntil then he's back in Oklahoma City. How ironic, he's in\n<acronym title=\"Oklahoma City, OK\">OKC</acronym> and I'm in\nBoston. We talked about <a href=\"http://www.deoxy.org/deoxy.htm\">Einstein's Theories of\nRelativity</a> for a while and he took off. We've been getting in\nlong discussions lately. It's healthy. You should try it.</p>\n<p>I'm starting to really think television is dumb. From <a href=\"http://www.clueless.com/jargon3.0.0/flame_war.html\">defending\nmy blog today</a> to engaging in long conversations, I must say\nthe human factor is much more important than watching the <a href=\"http://www.realamherst.com/tube.htm\">boob tube</a>. I know\nI watch it a lot, but I at least try to do more productive\nthings. If you ask someone what the best thing they did <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~porcello/mv/tv/tv.html\">while\nwatching TV</a> was, I bet it's a ton worse than the best thing\nthey've done without TV.</p>\n<p>I've starting ripping down my posters and packing some stuff\nup. With only three packing days left, <a href=\"http://www.zend.com/zend/cs/trialsport.php\">time is of the\nessence</a> for sure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/oh/athena2/cindy.html\">Sheesh!

Mark Somerville's two\ndaughters and I ran around <a href=\"http://www.needhamonline.com/background/history.html\">Needham</a>\nCenter in the park there.

We\nfeasted today yet again, trying to get rid of all this excess\nfood. My parents pointed out I talk about food a lot on here.\nYes, my parents do read this on a regular basis. <a href=\"http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=blog\">Blogging</a> is\na great way to both record what you've done and communicate it to\nfriends and family.</p>\n<p>I'm looking for a nice <a href=\"http://dhp.com/~alex/lamps/lamps.html\">lampshade</a>. Last\nyear I had an extra lightbulb lying around so I bought the most\nminimalist lamp I could find for it. It is literally a metal pole\nwith a lightbulb on top, nothing more. I even left it out without\na lampshade to be really minimalist. Now my goal is to find (or\ncreate?) a clear yet polarized (think sunglasses) lampshade that\nonly lets light come through at certain angles. <a href=\"http://pages.tias.com/3073/PictPage/681661.html\">Unfortunately</a>,\na <a href=\"http://www.boogle.com\">Google</a> search for \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=minimalist+clear+polarized+lampshade\">\nminimalist clear polarized lampshade</a>\" returns zero results.

Luckily my dad got these \"bonus points\" from <a href=\"http://www.aventis.com/\">his employer</a> (or should I say,\nthey gave him points in lieu of <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov\">actual money</a>) that can go\ntowards a new <a href=\"http://www.palm.com/products/palmm515/\">Palm m515</a>. I\nhope it's good; it looks like it is. Sometimes I can't help\nfeeling like the spoiled kid getting a new toy when his old one\nbroke. There was a guy at <a href=\"http://www.edmond.k12.ok.us/santafe/\">my high school</a>\nwho totalled his Corvette convertible (or whatever) and so his\nparents bought him a <a href=\"http://www.hummer.com\">Hummer</a>\nthe next day.

I'm sitting on the\ndeck behind the <acronym title=\"Modular Residence Hall\"><a href=\"http://www.modspace.com/case_studies/muhlenberg.html\">Mod</a></acronym>.\nThe air is moist and clean, and it is still quite warm out, for\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=12%3A45+AM\">\n12:45 AM</a> at least. I'm looking at the new campus, where I'll\nbe living in two weeks. I took some pictures of it, which I'll\ntry to post later, although it's very dark and they didn't come\nout so well. Susan said some buildings were inspected the last\nfew days, but none have probably passed yet. Soon we will be\nmoving equipment over.</p>\n<p>I wrote my learning plan today. Actually I only started it. I\nhave to have it done by Thursday to show to my advisor, Prof. <a href=\"http://www.dynetics.com/news/y02News/haysAward.htm\">Mike\nMoody</a>. It was more of just a draft. Probably I should be more\nserious. Or not. I still have lots of time, relatively\nspeaking.</p>\n<p>I have a theory. There are two types of people: car people and\ncomputer people. I know this is an overgeneralization, but for\nmost cases there is something similar you can replace \"<a href=\"http://www.aws.org/\">car</a>\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.arrl.org/\">computer</a>\" with. Car people are\nmore inclined to involve themselves with corporeal physical\nobjects, while computer people are more abstract and work with\nideas. The distinction arose when I realized that while many\npeople <a href=\"http://www.hotrodhillbillies.com/\">hotrod their\ncars</a>, there is a growing class of people who <a href=\"http://www.hanaho.com/products/HotRodJoystick/\">hotrod\ntheir computers</a>. This may seem silly to traditionalists, but\nthen again, hotrodding cars seems silly to us <a href=\"https://www.slashdot.org\">computerites</a>. For car people,\nwhere you are is very important. Having a nice car can get you to\nyour friends' houses and into the city, or on <a href=\"http://www.travelocity.com\">long vacations</a>. Likewise,\nfor computer people, the Internet can fulfill many of these\ndesires. Sure, no person wants to stick in front of the screen\nall day, but computer people are more likely to look something up\nin a <a href=\"http://promo.net/pg/\">book</a> before they ask\nsomeone else's opinion. Sometimes this book just happens to be\nthe Internet. Anyway, if you have any comments, please <a href=\"mailto:nertzy@cox.netREMOVETHIS\">shoot them my way</a>, and\nI might post them in an update here or work them into a more\npermanent page. Adam and I applied this theory further, deciding\nthe difference holds equally true for <acronym title=\"Electrical Engineers\"><a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/\">EEs</a></acronym> and <acronym title=\"Mechanical Engineers\"><a href=\"http://www.asme.org/\">MEs</a></acronym>.</p>\n<p>My other theory is that there is a nerd-jock spectrum, and if\nyou watch <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/index.html\">\nConan</a> you're more towards the nerd side. Jocks tend to watch\n<a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/latenight/latelate/\">Craig\nKilborn</a>. That's just the way it is.</p>\n<p>I just heard a train go by. These are the things you miss when\npent up inside all day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist\">Dan</a> has this\ndemo of a program from <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com\">NVidia</a>\nthat lets you type in an address anywhere on Earth and then zooms\nin on it really close using satellite data. What sets this apart\nfrom those <a href=\"http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/\">satellite\nwebsites</a> is the fact that the Earth is rendered in full 3D\nand the zooming is entirely to scale. Dan can see the playset\nthing in the backyard of his old house in Lake Forest, IL. You\ncan also see people waiting in line in front of the <a href=\"http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Pyramide_du_Louvre.html\">\nI.M. Pei pyramid</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.louvre.fr/\">Louvre</a>.

Oklahoma City is at a much lower resolution on the\nEarth viewer, so you can't make out a lot of stuff.\nCoincidentally, there is an <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/travel/vacations/great/gardens.htm\">\nI.M. Pei structure</a> in Oklahoma City.</p>\n<p>Today I spent over $1000 of Olin's money. Well actually I <a href=\"http://www.digikey.com\">ordered electrical supplies</a> for\nGill. He told me what to buy, but still it is nice placing a\nfour-digit cost order online over a <a href=\"http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/\">wireless ethernet\nconnection</a>.

I got a new case,\nmotherboard, power supply, processor, and floppy drive. And I\ndidn't buy a single one at the listed price. Let's hear it for <a href=\"http://www.msjudith.net/other/021199.htm\">haggling</a>! I\nfeel like quite the barterer. For those of you who haven't tried\nhaggling, <a href=\"http://rushowners.se7ens.net/deanh1.htm\">the\nrush</a> that comes afterwards is infectious. Of course I used\nthis opportunity to live up to my nerd status and not only build\nit myself, but also install <a href=\"https://www.suse.com\">SuSE\nLinux</a>. And not from some sissy CDs or DVD; I used three\nfloppies to get enough on there to install by FTP. So there!</p>\n<p>Other than that I cleaned up one of our dryers. It turns out\nthat <a href=\"http://www.vayusa.com\">Ajay</a>, our <acronym title=\"Resident Assistant\">RA</acronym>, or more accurately the\nguy who lives here and hasn't interacted with a single soul all\nyear, put his boots in the dryer, leaving it quite marked. This\nwas before I got here. The other students gave him an <a href=\"http://www.selfknowledge.com/102039.htm\">ultimatum</a>. He\nnever did clean it up, however, so <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/wclayton\">Will</a> and I found\nourselves doing it instead. He just got back today from Oregon,\nhis home.</p>\n<p>Adam is leaving tomorrow. Back to <a href=\"http://www.state.vt.us\">Vermont</a>! He put together our <a href=\"http://recycle.olin.edu\">recycling program</a>. <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/lige\">Leighton</a> is leaving too.\nI think he said he's going to <a href=\"http://canada.gc.ca/\">Canada</a>. His parents are in the\narea for awhile, so he'll be pretty busy for the next week or\nso.</p>\n<p>Right now I'm installing lots of <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org\">Free Software</a> using <a href=\"http://www.ximian.com/products/ximian_red_carpet/\">Ximian\nRed Carpet</a>. It's pretty easy. I like free things.</p>\n<p>We watched <a href=\"http://lax.gaz.nu/wonka/\">Willy Wonka and\nthe Chocolate Factory</a> today. Yes, we watched <a href=\"http://www.wonka.com/\">Willy Wonka</a>. To be more\naccurate, I slept through most of it.</p>\n<p>A lot of people are gone this weekend. Sara, Susan (for a\nwhile), Adam and Leighton (soon), Jeff (who lives at home <a href=\"http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/\">5 miles away</a>, not here at\nOlin), Steve and Susan (again) (just for the day tomorrow) (<a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us\">New Jersey</a>), and Nicole.

Everyone is so excited to see fresh new\nfaces. We're actually going to have enough people to have some\nsemblence of parties and clubs and social activities. We also\ndon't have to keep calling ourselves <a href=\"http://www.partners.org/\">prefreshmen</a>. That got old\nfast.

I must say it's not\nreally a lot like the Tex-Mex I'm used to, so I assume it's more\nlike actual Mexico food. The name at least implies a more\ncentrally located Mexican cuisine. Mmm, <a href=\"http://www.differentworld.com/mexico/common/pages/history_notes/tenochtitlan.htm\">\nTenochtitlan</a>. The salsa was milder and sweeter than my On The\nBorder fare from a couple days ago, and comes highly recommended.\nI was pretty happy when Dan asked me how to say \"beans\" in\nSpanish and I subconsciously thought \"<a href=\"http://frijoles.hungry.com/\">frijoles</a>\". I don't know\nvery much Spanish, and I thought I was wrong, but <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/cchavez\">Chris</a> confirmed that\nI was right.</p>\n<p>Today we watched three episodes of <a href=\"http://www.trekdoc.com/\">Star Trek</a>. I must admit\nstraightforwardly that I used to be <em>very</em> into Star Trek.\nI know, I know. Well it was fun because everyone currently here\nhad seen pretty much every episode before so we had plenty of\nopportunity to <a href=\"http://www.nitcentral.com/\">heckle</a>\nit. Being a proto-engineer causes me to see through the tech\nmumbo-jumbo, but it's fun to watch nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Work was pretty basic today. I spent 6.5 hours working on a\ndocument. That can get old.</p>\n<p>Now my mom is a finalist for <a href=\"http://www.millionairetv.com\">Millionaire</a> also. She\ndrove up to Tulsa to take the <a href=\"http://www.millionairetv.com/auditions.html\">test</a>, so\nnow both of my parents have a relatively small chance of making\nit on to the now daily syndicated show. I hope it comes near\nBoston soon!</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I'm going to the <a href=\"http://www.pcshow.com\">PC\nShow</a>. I'm going to check prices on <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com\">New Egg</a> first. New Egg is a\ngreat place to get components. I've only heard good reviews, and\nthe prices are reasonable if not superior. If I find cheaper\nstuff at the show, however, I'm going for it.</p>\n<p>The <acronym title=\"Electrical and Computer Engineering\">ECE</acronym> lab is\nmoving from the <acronym title=\"Modular Academic Center\">MAC</acronym> to campus on\nTuesday. This means I will quickly move from a desk job to a hard\nlabor job. I get to lug boxes!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com\"><acronym title=\"Cable News Network\">CNN</acronym></a> has a ton of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/wtc.ideas/\">user-submitted\ndesigns</a> for a <acronym title=\"World Trade Center\">WTC</acronym> memorial. Most of them\nare quite pitiful. Dan is constantly emailing me ones that outbad\nthe previous entries as they are released each day. In our\n<acronym title=\"Art Independent Study\">Art IS</acronym> class\nduring the <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu/news/yearend.html\">Partner Year</a>,\nseveral students and I designed <acronym title=\"World Trade Center\">WTC</acronym> and Pentagon memorial\nideas. Mine was more of an idea than an actual physical design,\ntaking only a piece of paper in the stead of a real model.</p>\n<p>I also built a <a href=\"http://www.thereminworld.com/\">theremin</a> for the class.\nThe theremin is the first electronic instrument, which you play\nby <a href=\"http://www.parascope.com/articles/1196/touch1.htm\">waving\nyour hands</a> toward and away from a pitch antenna and a volume\nantenna. It is very difficult indeed. You can play every tiny\nmicrotone between notes, although that is difficult as there is a\nfour-octave range over about a foot and a half of space. This\nmakes for <a href=\"http://www.parascope.com/articles/1196/touch1.htm\">crazy\nglissandos</a>. Theremins were popularized (and trivialized) by\ntheir use in 50s-era <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/nc/deadskeletons/horror.html\">cheesy\nB horror</a> and space movies.</p>\n",

I\nalso listened to one of the <a href=\"https://www.monster.com\">candidates</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.hotjobs.com\">position</a> of our new <a href=\"http://www.roguelibrarian.net\">librarian</a>. She gave us\nall postcards with stamps on them so we could write back to her\nin <a href=\"http://www.state.or.us\">Oregon</a>. Great idea.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.paintinglight.net\">Jesse</a> has some cool\npictures on his site. You should check them out sometime. He once\ndid a photo shoot for the up-and-coming R&amp;B star <a href=\"http://www.sharissa.com\">Sharissa</a>. Right now he goes to\n<a href=\"http://www.usc.edu\">USC</a> and is a film major.</p>\n<p>Earlier today I promised myself that I wouldn't spend so much\ntime on <a href=\"http://www.sorabji.com/2002/july/14/\">mundane\ndetails of my life</a> and devote more time to abstract thoughts.\n<a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist\">Dan</a> and I have\nlong abstract discussions into the wee hours pretty much every\nnight. Right now I'm spending the wee hours writing this,\nhowever. Of course I don't know what abstract is supposed to mean\nin this context. Maybe I'll just tell old stories instead.</p>\n<p>I'm listening to <a href=\"http://www.beck.com\">Beck</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.odelay.com/\">Odelay</a> right now. My fifth\nalbum ever. Dan is talking to me about some <a href=\"https://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/\">Flash</a> museum\ninstallation they have in <a href=\"http://www.iheartny.com/\">New\nYork City</a>. It reminds me of the <a href=\"http://www.praystation.com\">Praystation</a> exhibit at <a href=\"http://www.ilovelondon.com/\">London</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.designmuseum.org/\">Design Museum</a>. Joshua\nDavis is a Flash master. He pretty much rules the world while\neveryone else catches up. He once sold the entire contents of his\nhard drive, including personal files and unreleased Flash code,\nin a limited-edition box set.</p>\n<p>While at the museum, I bought a book about fontography. I hope\nto write a font someday. I might be able to convince <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu\">the college</a> to give me credit for\nit. (or perhaps just recognition on my transcript)</p>\n<p>Every student currently at Olin went to <a href=\"http://www.olin.edu/news/news_stories/rod.html\">Rod</a>'s\nhouse today. <a href=\"http://people.brandeis.edu/~lexfri/thoughts.html\">Rod\nCrafts</a> is our Dean of Student Life. He has a wonderful\nbackyard that is on a small cliff and has many levels of ground\nwith chairs set up so you can look down over the gardens below.\nWe had burgers.</p>\n<p>The new students (and all the old ones too) arrive in a couple\nweeks. We all can't wait.</p>\n<p>Look for some of <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com/citron\">my\nmusic</a> over the next few days on this site. I've been meaning\nto make a new section dedicated to my music and some MP3s. The <a href=\"http://www.riaa.org\">RIAA</a> can just cry, because they\nhave no power over my music. I used to go by the moniker <a href=\"http://john.bonobo.free.fr/citron1.htm\">Citron</a>, but now\nI'm just simply Grant Hutchins. Keep that in mind when referring\nto my music. I've been meaning to tell <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com\">Jon</a> about this for some time\nnow.</p>\n<p>Speaking of, Jon asked me for the original <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/photoshop\">Photoshop</a> file for one\nof the little <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com/nfbg.gif\">logos</a> on his <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com\">page</a>. He's making stationery\nI heard. Watch out for some new stuff soon.</p>\n<p>While I'm in the mood for plugging old friends, check out <a href=\"http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com\">Tucker</a>'s new\n<a href=\"http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com/djmixes.php\">DJ\nmix</a>, \"Trance 8.8.02\". He's amazing at mixing. My favorite\ntransition is the one in \"Electronic 5.28.02\" from <a href=\"http://www.crystalmethod.com\">Crystal Method</a>'s \"Busy\nChild\" to <a href=\"http://www.loopz.co.uk\">Orbital</a>'s\n\"<acronym title=\"&quot;August&quot; in Gaelic\">An Fhomhair</acronym>\".\nSimply amazing stuff.</p>\n",

Part of the day was spent\nwatching a video of crazily efficient wooden wall-mounted kinetic\nsculptures with some classmates and <a href=\"http://www.asee.org/precollege/flowers.cfm\">Woodie\nFlowers</a>. One of the cohorts at Olin will be working on\nkinetic sculptures similar to these but most undoubtedly less\nambitious. The sculptures from the video could run for ten hours\non a tiny wind of a wheel.</p>\n<p>Nicole was going to fly to Oregon today, but when her plane\ntook off, one of the engines started emitting flames so it landed\nand she has to fly out tomorrow very early in the morning. She\ntalked very nonchalantly about it.</p>\n<p>This summer I didn't do much of consequence. One thing I am\nproud of, however, was working with <a href=\"http://www.normalform.com\">Jon</a> on an anti-drug <acronym title=\"Public Service Announcement\">PSA</acronym> television\ncommercial he made. He's going to try to sell it to companies or\nchurches to put their logo on in the final scene. I went to see\nhim at <acronym title=\"Oklahoma City Community College\">OCCC</acronym> and we\nwent to lunch at <a href=\"http://www.tacobell.com\">Taco Bell</a>.\nAfterwards, I created a sound file for them to use in the video.\nIt was the sound of a coffin closing, followed by an echo. I made\nthe sound from a bass drum dropped a couple octaves. It was a fun\ntask; hopefully I can work like this in the future, possibly for\npay. I did get a 2-channel <a href=\"http://www.geminidj.com/\">Gemini</a> mixer out of the whole\ndeal.</p>\n<p>I broke out the first large jar of <a href=\"http://www.ontheborder.com/\">On The Border</a> salsa today.\nIt has a very meaty, rich flavor to it. I highly suggest it if\nit's sold in your area. <a href=\"http://www.logicalrealist.com\">Sean</a> sure seemed to like\nit. I think he's addicted like me.</p>\n<p>Only 18 days until the new freshmen come! I just realized the\nschool will more than double (from 30 to 75) this year, and it\nwill also more than double (75 to ~175) next year. What school\ndoes that?</p>\n<p>On Saturday I'm going to the <a href=\"http://www.pcshow.com\">PC Show</a> to look for parts for my\n<a href=\"http://www.linux.org\">Linux</a> desktop server I plan on\npurchasing. Dan and I spent hours trying to set up his NVidia\ncard some more, with no luck.</p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/sschwalbenberg\">Sara</a> and I\nwent out onto the back deck and did something odd. She took a\nmeasuring bowl full of 2 cups of water and poured some on the\nbottoms of my feet. I think walked around and she looked at the\nfootprints to note how flat my feet are. We then both stepped in\na puddle thus formed and did a <a href=\"http://www.mysimon.com\">side-by-side comparison</a>.</p>\n<p>For lunch I made mashed potatoes, but put too much water in it\n(continuing the <a href=\"http://www.sally-save-water.com/\">wasteful water use</a>\ntheme). Luckily I had some potato chips to crumble and put into\nit. It may sound odd but I enjoyed it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.areafestival.com\">Area 2 Festival</a>\nwas great! Let me run down what it was like.</p>\n<p>First I came in and barely missed <a href=\"http://www.djdieselboy.com/\">Dieselboy</a>'s set in the <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com\">Playstation 2</a> DJ tent,\nwhich was disappointing since I generally prefer jungle to\ntrance, but then <a href=\"http://www.djtiesto.com/\">DJ\nTiësto</a> came in and was pretty good, but I decided to\nleave to see the entire <a href=\"http://www.blueman.com\">Blue Man\nGroup</a> show on the main stage. Their show was pretty good,\nfull of crazy percussion madness, although the audience\nparticipation doesn't work with that size of an audience. It was\na little awkward at times. Hungry, I ate an expensive and\nmisnomered \"Chicken Sandwich Deluxe\", which consisted of a slab\nof tough chicken on a bun. Hits the spot every time. After we\nlearned that <a href=\"http://www.bustarhymes.com\">Busta\nRhymes</a> wasn't going to show, <a href=\"http://www.tuckermcclureunderground.com\">Tucker</a>, <a href=\"http://students.olin.edu/dlindquist\">Dan</a>, and I\nreturned to the tent to see <a href=\"http://www.johndigweed.com\">John Digweed</a>, the\nnumber-one-rated DJ in the world by most accounts. He was really\ngood, and I found myself able to enjoy his style of music, even\nthough I'm usually not up for it. I was dancing pretty heavily,\nso my glasses flew off my face twice. After I was sufficiently\ntired Dan and I caught the end of <a href=\"http://www.davidbowie.com/\">David Bowie</a>'s set. A lot of\npeople there completely loved it, but I just sorta liked it. I'm\nnot the Bowie type but it was good. After that I caught some <a href=\"http://www.carlcox.com\">Carl Cox</a> in the tent which was\nalso quite fun, but only stayed for a few minutes because of the\nimportant matter at hand:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moby.com\">Moby</a>.</p>\n<p>Moby was great, as usual. I've seen him before, with Bush in\nthe Campus Invasion tour in Norman, OK. This time around he was a\nlot funnier. He had a Krusty sticker from the Simpsons on his\nguitar. He also put on a wig and acted like a metal guy for a\nwhile. He was a lot more interesting this time around, even if he\ndidn't play \"All I Need Is To Be Loved\" or \"Oil 1\", two of my\nfavorite songs. He didn't jump on top of his keyboard or play a\nvery long guitar solo, but otherwise it was Moby at his best. The\nfirst encore he played was a quick cover of the \"Hey ho! Let's\ngo!\" punk song. The whole night you could tell he really wanted\nto cover something (other than just the \"James Bond Theme\" as\nusual) He ended with \"Feeling So Real\" just like last time, so I\nwas happy to say the least.</p>\n<p>Right now after the show Dan, Leighton, Chris and I are\ndrinking <a href=\"http://drinks.glowport.com/942.html\">virgin\nmargaritas</a> and listening to mellow jazz on <a href=\"http://streams.wgbh.org/wgbh/\">'GBH</a>. All and all a very\ngood day, although expensive for sure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"newsupdate\">\n<div class=\"updatedate\">August 5, 2002</div>\n<div class=\"updatetext\">The song Moby covered was <a href=\"http://w1.131.telia.com/~u13108580/ramonesmidis/blitzkrieg_bop.mid\">\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\"</a> by <a href=\"http://www.officialramones.com/\">The Ramones</a>.</div>\n</blockquote>\n",

I had the hardest time\ntrying to change this webpage from <a href=\"http://www.state.ok.us\">Oklahoma</a>.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I'm going to the <a href=\"http://www.areafestival.com\">Area 2</a> festival. It will\nlast from 3:30 pm on to probably the wee hours, and features <a href=\"http://www.moby.com\">Moby</a>, David Bowie, Busta Rhymes,\nand <a href=\"http://www.blueman.com\">Blue Man Group</a>. I've\nalready seen Moby and Blue Man Group before. When I went to the\nMoby show I bought a Moby t-shirt. When I went to the Blue Man\nGroup show I wore that shirt, because I figured they would like\nMoby. Later that year, after both of them got much more famous,\nthey performed together at the Grammy Awards. I think they saw my\nshirt and put two and two together. Anyway, now Moby has selected\nBlue Man Group to be in his second Area Festival, and it's all\nthanks to my shirt.</p>\n<p>Dan, Steve, Chris and I went to the Framingham 15 theater to\nsee Austin Powers 3. It was still sold out, so we left. Dan just\ntold me something interesting about the Framingham 15, which has\none of the less than 20 all-digital screens in the country. It\nturns out the AMC Framingham 15 was once the General Cinemas 16.\nIt turns out this theater also has one of the two \"luxury\"\ntheaters that serve alcohol. When AMC bought the facility out,\nsays Dan, who is only moderately sure of this, they were only\ngiven 15 of the theaters, the \"luxury\" theater staying with\nGeneral Cinemas. You learn something new everyday.</p>\n<p>Dan also showed me <a href=\"http://www.halfbakery.com\">Half\nBakery</a>, a place where you can brainstorm ideas and then\npeople vote on them. I then showed him <a href=\"http://www.everything2.com\">everything2</a>, a strange\nmish-mash of writeups on any topic imaginable. In fact, if you\nimagine something that isn't there, you get to write it up\nyourself.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"newsupdate\">\n<div class=\"updatedate\">August 4, 2002</div>\n<div class=\"updatetext\">It turns out that AMC bought out General\nCinemas; we were wrong. They are all owned by the same company\nnow.

She&rsquo;s only about 2 I think and she told me when I was banging the drums to &ldquo;stop making so many noises.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a little smartie! After that I headed over to Jesse&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s residence, where I watched Jesse&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s videos. A@ron does sketch comedy in a troupe at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Occidental College<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the &ldquo;Sketchy People.&rdquo; We then went to Jesse&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s residence to see what A@ron got Jesse for his graduation. It was a toilet. A@ron filmed Jesse and me as we sprayed it with a hose. For about 45 minutes. We also pretended like sticks were our arms and beat the toilet with them. And then this kid walked up with a Super Soaker, so Jesse made him squirt the toilet in the front yard. Oh yeah, and it was filled with red paint. After that we went to Casady&rsquo;s graduation. They have bagpipes instead of Pomp and Circumstance and a &ldquo;Senior speaker&rdquo; instead of a Valedictorian. At the fun reception thing afterwards, this girl came up to me. I remembered her from the Casady last-day-of-school party in which we had our picture taken for some reason. She told me that it was developed and came out well and then told me she&rsquo;d mail it to me and walked off. I don&rsquo;t know how she knows where I live, and I thought she didn&rsquo;t even have my last name. Creepy. After graduation, I went to Aimee&rsquo;s house. For those of you who are less informed, Aimee is the friend of Jackie, who is Jesse&rsquo;s girlfriend. I&rsquo;ve never really hung out with them before, and we had fun. We went to the coffeehouse by Galileo&rsquo;s and played 20 questions. The things we had to guess: Dennis Rodman, herniated disc, space shuttle Challenger, and big turtle.
